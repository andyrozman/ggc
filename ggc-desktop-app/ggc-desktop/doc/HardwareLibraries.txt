HARDWARE LIBRARIES
===================

For accessing diabetes hardware, we use special 3rd party libraries. Some are our own ports (because of requirement of Java 1.5 (5)),
some are official.

Comment:           This is old IBM Serial API library used for Bluetooth support for Dana pump. Needs to be replaced,
                   but at time of implementation, our serial library at that time Rxtx 2.1.7, had problems with BT
                   devices. Our current NrJavaSerial is actually just extension of RXTX 2.2, so it might actually
                   support this now, but we can't test it at this time (no hardware).
