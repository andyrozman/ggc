HOW To GGC
===========

1. Purpose of this documnet

Some time ago, I got message from fellow programer, stating that GGC is very hard to use. 
If you would have seen image on my face, you would have started laughing and never stoped. 
I was flbaergasted... GGC is really intuitive and easy to use... for me. But then I started 
thinking from his side of view... GGC evolved from from the first version quite much. There 
are lot of nifty features, only problem is that they aren't documented. GGC started from 
simple software, now to software with many features and also many options. I will try to give
you short overview of evrything in this documentation and most of this, will be later added 
to help (where possible).


2. What is Open Source

You are wondering why I am starting with this. I want to make sure that you understand, why 
open source software is different from software you buy. Open source means that application 
is free, it also means that it depends on help of other people around. In most cases (as is 
with GGC) people work on application in their free time. So after I finish with work and I get 
to home where I work further to get GGC better. If you have programming experience (we work
with java, but if you have any programming experience, you could help) or wish to help with
translation (soon we will put out nice and shiny tool for translations), please contact us
at ggc(at)atech-software.com.  

 
3. Software mode

GGC can now work in two modes. One is Pen/Injection mode, which is intended for Insulin therapy 
without pump and of course Pump theraphy. This software is mainly intended for Type 1 diabetics
(or all those that use insulin regualary), but it doesn't mean that you can't use it anyway. 
Now if you use GGC in Pump mode, this doesn't mean that any option will be closed, but you get 
different buttons in toolbar and also General info changes (in Pump mode we use only one insulin,
while in Pen/Injection (in further text Pen) mode we use at least two insulins, GGC now supports 
use of third insulin (by user request), but it must be enabled in configuration. Also Pump mode
has different statistics displayed (not fully implemented yet).


4. What are Tools/Plugins?

GGC has several parts to it. Main part is called GGC Core, it contains all parts that communicate 
with databases and handles any requests, actions and all commands. That part you see is called 
GGC Desktop. This part displays and uses all other parts. After that we have several Tools, of
which it's has it's own part to do. In first plan, Tools did communication with several types
of diabetes hardware, so we now have Meter Tool, Pump Tool and now new one CGMS Tool. At first 
it was inteded that this Tools, work only on communication with devices, but now each of Tools
has more than this to do. For example Pump Tool doesn't just communicate with Pump devices, but it 
also handles all pump action (Manual data input, Graphs, Printing and everything else).
Now we also have one additional Tool which doesn-t communicate with any device, but just with 
database. It's called Nutrition plugin and it handles all actions with Nutrition/Meals databases.


5. Main user window

Main user window displays several data windows, which show General settings, Plugin status, Devices 
availability (configuration) and Statistics. In main user window we also have Menus, which are used
to access all that GGC has to offer. There are also several buttons in toolbar, to get easier 
access to main functions.


6. Adding Daily data

Main function of GGC is dialog for adding Daily data.
