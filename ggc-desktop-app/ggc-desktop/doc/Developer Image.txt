DEVELOPER VIRTUAL BOX IMAGE
============================

Since we had some complaints from people who are not acquinted with Maven, that they have
problems getting Development running, I decided to create Developer image, contaning all
software needed for starting development.

IMAGE CONTENT:
--------------
- Lubuntu Image 16.10 (x386)
- Subversion 1.8
- Maven 3.0.5
- Java 1.5 (for compiling GGC)
- Java 1.8 (for IntelliJ)
- local maven cache for start working (no download needed)
- IntelliJ 14 - Community edition (I am still using this version, because it works best, and
     all later changes are pretty bad)
- Some Intellij Plugins: Save Actions, Eclipse Formatter.
- PostgreSQL 9.1 with PgAdmin III. (with empty ggc database)

Read-only repositories of:
- Atech-Software
- GGC


HOW CAN I START
---------------
1. Download image
2. Start it in your Virtual Box
3. When box is running install "Virtual Box Guest Additions" (for better resolution)

And that's it. You can try out the GGC. You can run Intellij and start GGC from there. (with latest
version available in Image)


START WITH NEVER VERSION
------------------------

Image of GGC might be older one, so you should probably go to:  ~/workspaces/ggc
and run "svn update", same in ~/workspaces/ggc/atech-tools.

After that just run "mvn clean install" in ~/workspaces/ggc


START OF DEVELOPMENT
--------------------

If you want to start contributing you should check out repositories again with your own
sourceforge.net username and password (so that you can checkin changes made).


NOTES
-----
We are still supporting Java 1.5, which is why Java 1.5 is installed. Maven 3.0.5 also
supports Java 1.5 (it might be the last version that does). There is also Java 8 installed,
but that is only so that we can run IntelliJ. JavaC points to java 1.5. Theoretically
you can use any version of java you want, but code checked in needs to be in strict 1.5 format.
While you can set target to 1.5 in maven, it usually doesn't check if you have writen it
correctly, which in turn means that it won't be compilable with java 1.5.

There is PostgreSQL database installed with ggc_v7 instance and your development environment
will start with it, so that you can easily go to database and see data there (pgAdminIII is
installed for browsing database).

You can also run with standard local database (same as with running application), but
in that case you are limited with one instance of application.
