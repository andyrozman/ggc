
HOW I CAN HELP WITH GNU Gluco Control
=====================================

As I said before... this is open source project, which means you can help anywhere you want/can.

There are several chapters please read at least those that concern you.


A.) Testing software and give new ideas or propose changes (intended for ALL)
B.) Adding support for different diabetes hardware (Anybody who wishes to have their hardware supported)
C.) Translation (if you want to help with translation to your native language)
D.) Development



---- 


A.) Testing software and give new ideas or propose changes (intended for ALL)
==============================================================================

There are several ways you can help. The first and major way is to test software.
Try to use it and find anything that doesn't work. Version 0.3 will be started from
the command-line and all actions will also be displayed in the console. If you see
an error text, exception or e.g. many cryptic lines of classes with numbers, this
means something went wrong. The error is displayed on your screen, but it is also
logged to a file (in <GGC_Root>\data\log). There you will find one or more files for
each day. If an error happened today, there will be a file named 'GGC.log'. You need
to open it and go to end and try to find the previously displayed errors.
Zip this file and store it. And do the following (choose option A or B):

a.) Visit the bug reporting site for our project and enter the bug by yourself.
   Please attach the zipped log. The site is (data should be entered in English):
   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49749&atid=457319  
   You don't need to be member at sourceforge to add this information, if you are
   not please, write your email address somewhere in the error report. Describe
   exactly what you were doing when the exception occurred and how the problem
   affected your application. Also please let us know the configuration of your
   computer (for example: Celereon 2000 with 2 Gb Ram, running Ubuntu Linux,
   kernel 2.4.1.34, with java 1.6_06)

b.) Send us an email (ggc@atech-software.com), with all the data described in A).

---

If everything works OK on your system, we still ask you to send us logs. Every month
or so, please zip all log files (you can remove them from the log directory) and
send them to ggc@atech-software.com.

We will use some tool to look through all files and see if there was some error
which has gone undiscovered by you and will try to fix it.

---

So you have been using the software for some time, some things work fine, other not
so well. If you find parts of GGC, which your think could work better, please let us
know. If you find that some functionality is missing, again, let us know. You can
use either email, or you can use the following form (data should be entered in
English):
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49749&atid=457322

---

We will try to fix problems as soon as possible, but since there are only two of us
(three, but only two active) it might take some time... Major bugs will be fixed
first, then the minor ones...
New functionality proposals have the lowest priority (and planned functionality has
priority).

Maybe some new developers will now join us and help us with further development of
this application.




B.) Adding support for different diabetes hardware (Anybody who wishes to have their hardware supported)
==========================================================================================================

Please first take a look at file 'Diabetes_Hardware.txt'. All entries there are planned hardware support. This 
doesn't mean we don't need help. We will need at least some help with testing.

If your device is not on list, or doesn't have developer name set, then it means there are no immidiate plans. 

For adding support we need protocol (language) that device speaks and computer understands. In best case scenario, 
we would contact device company and get this data from them, but in most cases they are not really cooperating, so 
we need to do it with trial and error approach.

In this case you need to post a message on Forum board on sourceforge.net, called Hardware/Device support
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=813903, that you are willing to help us... What we will need 
from you is little time. You need to be able to install software on your computer...

What you need to do/have:
1.) Install original software for device
2.) You need cable/interface for device
3.) You need to install software Serial Monitor (it's nor freeware, but you can get Trial version that lasts for
    two weeks. (http://www.hhdsoftware.com/Products/home/serial-monitor.html)

Serial Monitor will monitor communication between your device and original software. We need to know which 
commands are sent and what are replies. In most cases this will be enough for adding some support. If 
communication is encrypted there is no way for adding support.

So you have installed all software needed and next you need to do is, start Serial Monitor and then attach your 
device. Next step is to start original software and issue command for downloading data. After you are finished
close both programs and save logs in Serial Monitor. Send us the logs (in forum) or direct.

First part is finished... Now we will do some programming to add support for this device. After some time (it might
take months), you will get a test software, which you will need to run and then compare data that software will 
export with data in your device. If everything is OK, support for your device will be finalized in week or two, if 
not there will be additional testing going on.



C.) Translation (if you want to help with translation to your native language)
=================================================================================

If you like our software and want it to be available in your own language you can join our translation 
team. First you need to do is post message on Forum Translation with name (something like that)  
(http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=813898), 'Translation into Russian'. Please first go 
through all messages to find if someone is already trying to translate application. If yes, join his/hers
team, and together you will be finsihed faster...

After few days you will receive several files and tools that will help you with your task... 

Application GGC has several language files (2 for main application and one for each tool) and several
help files (since help files are not available yet we will ignore them for now).

Text files are ascii text files, which means that your special characters will not be recognized as 
such. What you need to do is get an editor which supports utf-8 format. After you have it, open files
you received and save them in UTF-8. After you are finished with translation you need to run 
application native2ascii, which is part of java development kit, which you need to install. 

Since GGC is in development this files will regulary change. You can either:
a) wait to get new translation request (this will be sent to all translators, after some bigger 
   functionality is completed)
b) install SVN and get all sources from SVN (if you are not registered developer you won't be able to
   check-in (send your files to us) direcly, but you can receive all files and see if something changed.
   You will still have to send your translation to us (via forum or direct), but we will add it as
   soon as we receive it.

In language files there are a lot of keywords, which are all under special groups, each group has a tag 
number. Each type of language file has different types of tags. This tag number tell you which groups 
need to be translated first. As for files, main file has pirority (GGC_<lang>), then comes Nutrition 
file (GGC_Nutrition_<lang>) and then all files from different tools


There are two tools to help with development (they are part of atech-tools, so you will get script to
run them):

1.) I18nCheck <base_lang_name> <default_lang>. This tool will display all keyword from all language files
    that are present in default_lang (this is always en) and not in all other files. Base lang name is for 
    example GGC, full name is GGC_<lang>.properties. This will help you find the new words easily.
    
2.) I18nTranslationCheck <base_lang_name> <default_lang> <our_lang>. This utility will show which 
    expressions are not translated yet. If translation and default are same, then there will be some
    false entries, but most of entries displayed will still be untranslated. To help yourself take a note
    of how many translations words are same, and subtract them from whole number.
      


D.) Development
==================

NOTE: For development we use Eclipse environment. We have several ant build files through all 
    of the projects, but this are intended for deployment only, and NOT for development. 
    Deployment is done by one person which is called Deployment manager (at this time - Andy). 
    In old times, our developers could choose whatever environment they wanted (so ant was 
    official build environment), but this created huge configuration problems, which needed to 
    be fixed for each new developer. When all of developers (2 at that time) started to use 
    Eclipse, and when we added sub-projects, problems became even bigger. At that point we decided to go with 
    official build environment, which is now Eclipse (so ant became little deprecated - we still use it for
    deployment (when new version is released)). This document was created to help all new developers and so far,
    we had almost no complaints from new users (when they arise, we usually just extend this document, with 
    additional data). 


If you are developer and would like to help, please follow this instructions to create build 
environment.

1.) Download full SVN sources from sourceforge.net then download SVN for atech-tools project.
    Write this(beginning with svn...) in a terminal window:
   [gast@frodo ~]$ svn co https://ggc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ggc/trunk ggc
   ,respectively:
   [gast@frodo ~]$ svn co https://atech-tools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/atech-tools/trunk atech-tools .
   After downloading the sources you will have two folders ../folder/gcc and ../folder/atech-tools inside of your folder.

2.) Download Eclipse. Eclipse is our official development tool, but you can use any other you wish.
    I am advising to use Galileo (Eclipse 3.5). Link http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/, 
    take latest stable build. Or you may find a downloadable package from your favorite repository that 
    is already built and ready to use for your system - just download it as you would with any software.
    
    Install subclipse for Eclipse: (you need to do this step before you go to 3. Subclipse is often 
    already packed and ready for download from your 
    favorite repository or follow the instructions below.
    
    Go to Eclipse Window -> Preferences -> Install/Update -> Available Software Sites -> Add -> 
    Location: http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x .
    Mark the Location you just added and press Enable button and Ok. Go to Help -> Check for Updates. Wait a few seconds so that the entry is added and 
    the file list is downloaded. Select Subclipse plugin.
    
3.) Create new workspace. 
    
    Open Windows->Preferences. Go to group Java->Code style->Formatter. Use Import option and add xml
    file stored under ggc-support/eclipse.
    
4.) a.) ATech-Tools
         * On workspace (Left window) do Import...
         * use General->Existing projects into workspace
         * In Select root directory -> Browse... for ../folder/atech-tools .         

    b.) GGC 
         * On workspace (Left window) do Import...
         * use General->Existing projects into workspace
         * In Select root directory -> Browse... for  ../folder/gcc .          
      
    Import all projects except "GGC Web Page"  (ggc-core, ggc-desktop, ggc-meter, ggc-pump, ggc-cgm, ggc-plugin_base, ggc-nutri)


    You should have 8 projects. 

5.) Add Libraries. 
	a.) Libraries are stored under ggc-support/eclipse. You need to expand each zip file into 
	    common directory (for example: c:\java\libs) 
	b.) Copy ggc_libs.userlibraries to some directory on your disk
	c.) Open this file in editor and replace all instances of 'D:/java/libs/' with your directory 
	    (in our example c:/java/libs/, Notes: you need last '/' and you can't use \, you must use
	     / instead (c:\java is in this case c:/java))
	d.) - Right click on one project (any will do), right click Build Path -> Add Libraries...  
	    - Select 'User Libraries' and click 'Next'
	    - Click button 'User Libraries...'
	    - Click button 'Import...'
	    - Select file you edited in c.)
	    
	Now libraries are added. You will have to probably change setting for native files for all
	libraries that have it (rxtx-2.2 and IBMComm). 
	 
    Note: IBMComm - this one runs only on windows and linux and its used for BlueTooth Connections
                just for one device so far (Pumps -> Dana pump)
    

6.) Run GGC

    Go to GGC Desktop/src/ggc/GGC.java (Right click on it, select Run As...->Java application
    
    Copy files from ggc-support/data
    
        data
          |-- db (unpack latest db image)
          |-- log (create directory)
          |-- nutrition (unpack file nutrition-SR-xx.zip (take latest))
          |-- skinlf_themes (copy all files from ggc-support/data/skinlf_themes)
          
    Copy ggc-support/data/GGC_Config.properties
    
    Change run entry for GGC-Desktop:
    - Open run configuration. 
    - Select tab Arguments. 
    - Go to working directory. Select other.
    - Click on Workspace... Select GNU Gluco Control/bin
    
7.) Eclipse Preferences: You will have to do this on every project or use Workspace settings
     Go into Project -> Properties
     
     - Java Compiler: 
          Compiler Compliance Level, set to 1.5
     
     - Java -> Compiler -> Javadoc
         Process Javadoc comments - Checked
         Malformed javadoc comments - Warning
            Only consider members as visible as: Public
            Missing tag descriptions: Ignore
            
         Missing javadoc tags: Warning
            Only consider members as visible as: Public

         Missing javadoc comments: Warning
            Only consider members as visible as: Public

	We are currently on 1.5 compatibility, so that application is usable on most of systems, which 
	don't have 1.6 available... 
        NOTE: Officialy java 1.5 is not supported by Sun anymore. Since we would like older systems
              to be able to use GGC, we will stay with 1.5 for a while longer (at least till end of 2010),
              Sun has options to allow you to get older version of java. In worst case contact us
              at ggc@atech-software.com, and we will try to supply you with it. Sometimes setting 
              target to 1.5 is not enough.
	
	Javadoc. We are trying to start writing documentation and Javadoc is first step towards that.
	   Old code will be commented with time, mostly by the people who created the code. All new code needs
	   to have comments (javadoc and othwerwise). Eclipse will help you with making empty javadoc
	   comments, and then just fill all the data (upper javadoc wont check if arguments are filled, 
	   but they should be, since after some time we will enable that function, but for now we haven't 
	   since enabling javadoc by itself produces a lot of warnings).
	
	Comments. If you feel that your code might be hard to understand, please make a comment or two, 
	   so that other people can understand what you are trying to do. You don't need to comment
	   simple stuff, just stuff you feel could be hard to understand. 
    

8.) If you wish to test GGC Meter Tool, GGC Pump tool you will also need to set binaries for rxtx library. If 
    your development OS is either windows, linux, MacOS or sparc you are in luck. 
    
    Go to rxtx entry, right click on it, select Build Path -> Configure Build path
    Set Native Library Location


9.) If you wish to use any other database you need to have basic knowledge of JDBC

    A) Install database software. I advise PostgreSQL 8.x (drivers were already added)
    
    B) If you used any other database, add drivers to Eclipse
    
    C) Create database, database user and password
    
    D) Change GGC_Config.properties, there is one sample file with several samples for 
       different databases. Change SELECTED_DB to right number. Add right parameters:
       database name, user and password
       
    E) Now you will need to InitDb:
       a) Go to file GGC Gluco Control/src/ggc/core/db/tool/InitDb, do with it same as 
          with step 5 (not everything)
          
       b) Open file InitDb and find parameter passWord (String at start of file).
       
       c) Add value of parameter from b) as Arguments -> Program arguments
       
       d) Run InitDb


10.) Now you can start the real work... Good luck...


11.) Usefull libraries/tools for Eclipse:
     Window Builder Pro - http://dl.google.com/eclipse/inst/d2wbpro/latest/3.5
         GUI editor. Quite good, can be usefull for new GUIs.
     JAutoDoc - 
         For auto documentation of classes
     TK Eclipse Plugin HTML Editor - http://sourceforge.net/projects/amateras/ (DL)
         HTML editor
