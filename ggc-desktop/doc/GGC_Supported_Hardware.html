<h1>Diabetic devices and their status in GGC</h1>

In year 2006 our project was back on track and restructured, so we started to think about inclusion/support of diabetics devices.
<br><br>
In 2007 we started with support for Meter devices (GGC supported devices before, but support was little unorthodox and also 
unusable). In August 2007 we finished most of our Meter Tool and added first devices (Ascensia), to which we later added others.
<br><br>
At end of 2008 we started to work on Pump Tool, mainly on Manual adding of data, and later in next year we added our first pump
device to our support list (we had it on testing from company). Work now continues on adding more and more devices.

* Dana uses BlueTooth technology. We had some problem with communication, so we resorted to alternate solution, 
    which only had drivers for Windows and Linux platforms. We are trying to find sollution to use Dana through
    rxtx library (serial API), but this might take some time.

Appendix A: Drivers needed for cables for different hardware
==============================================================

In most cases we need special drivers for cables (not diabetes devices). Drivers usually come on CD, but 
not always, so here is little help. For some stuff, there can be more than one type of drivers, and cables
can also come in several varieties (USB, Serial, ...). 

Serial2USB (this can be used in case that we have cable with serial port and need to attach it to USB):
   - FTDI

Roche - Smart Pix is Mass Storage Device (it should work without drivers anywhere)

Lifescan - PL2303




Appendix B: Special considerations with some OSes
==================================================

1.) MAC

For using hardware on Mac you will need to do following:

Login as root (you need to have root account enabled)

mkdir /var/spool/uucp 
chmod 755 /var/spool/uucp 
mkdir /var/lock 
chmod 777 /var/lock 

Rxtx library uses different locks that are used on Mac, so this steps are necessary. In later version
of Rxtx this is reported to be fixed (since there was no offical release so far, we will have to 
wait and use upper work-around).

If you get your binary file for Rxtx from some other source than from ours, there might be some 
problems. You need to have librxtxSerial.jnilib and librxtxSerial.dylib present (they are both
the same, if you have one, you can just make another copy of same file or link)
