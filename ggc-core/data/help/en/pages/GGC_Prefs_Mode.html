<h1>Preferences - Mode</h1>

<h2>Application Mode</h2>
Application can be run in two modes. First is Pen/Injection Mode and other is Pump Mode. While
application is in no way different for both modes, setting correct mode, can help with usage of 
application. In both modes menus are the same (so the same functionality is available), but toolbar 
changes, so you can easier access most used commands. Also statistics change. In Pen/Injection mode
we get statistics data from Pen/Injection entries and in Pump mode from Pump entries (either read 
from device, or manually entered). <br>
<i>We must note here that reading from Meter devices stores data in both modes data entry.</i><br>

<h2>Pen/Injection Mode Settings</h2>
Here we can set settings for Pen/Injection theraphy. This is just precision of doses. Most devices 
are precise up to 1 unit, but now we have devices that are capable of administering also 0.5 units, 
so this is the place we can set this. Max Bolus/Basal setting are there just to prevent us adding
too high value by mistake.

<h2>Pump Mode Settings</h2>
Here we can set settings for Pump theraphy. This should be set to same values that are on your 
pump (software doesn't read and/or store settings from pumps). We have support in some pumps, to
read this settings (just for users review), but we never store them. So we need to "manually" set
this settings in software. Basal and Bolus precisions are the same as in Pen/Injection theraphy, 
except we have more options here (1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.025). Temporary basal type can be set on
what your pump suppoorts, some support TBR in procents and some (mostly older) in units. If your 
device allows just one type you can limit application here, and you don't need to set all 
settings (that are not needed by you).
