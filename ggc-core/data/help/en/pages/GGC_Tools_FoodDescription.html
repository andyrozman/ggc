<h1>Tools - Food by Description</h1>
<br>
In most cases we don't want to search in database to add food to our daily entries, in this
cases we can use this function. Now you have several options to add data here:
<blockquote>
<li>You can either write all foods into main text box and then add CHs into Carbohydrates text box 
(or leave it empty).</li>
<li>You can use special [] entries in which you specify CHs (for example: Bread [20]). If you click
on calculate all entries in [] will be summed together.
<li>You can also use special [] functions. [] can be used as simple calculator, you can use * or x 
to multiply entries (example: Bread 100g [100x0.5]). On calculate all this entries will be 
multiplied, now you can use factors (50% of weight of bread is CH, so I used factor 0.5), or you can
multiply current weight (divided by 100) with amount of CH in 100g of food (example: Potatoes 200g [2x18.75]) 
in this case we know that 100g of Potatoes has 18.75g of CH.    
</li>
</blockquote>
This functionality can make your life much easier especially if you use foods that you know 
values for.
