<h1>Pen/Injection Daily Entry Add/Edit</h1>

This is one of most important dialogs. It helps us to add daily entry data. This part
that has involved the most since it's main entry dialog. To fully understand power
of this wonderful dialog, we will go through all parts of it.

At first we need to set Date and Time. When we start from Daily View, and click on Add
Date is already set on Day from which we called Add. So we only need to set the Time.

BG entry allows us to enter data in either mmol/L or mg/dL. If we enter in one format,
data is automatically converted in other format.

There are two insulins we can enter. Bolus and Basal (both have names set which we 
predefined in Configuration). We can enter data for Bolus manually or use Bolus 
Helper.

Urine entry is text based entry so we can add description here...

Activity is also descriptional entry, where we describe activity and its duration.
