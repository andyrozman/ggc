<h1>GNU Gluco Control</h1>

<h2>About software</h2>
GNU Gluco Control (in further help GGC) is open source software, which means that is free and it's
created by people (in their free time), so it also means that it comes with no guarantee that it will 
work 100%. We are trying to do our best, but since our team is very small, we can only do so much.<br>
<br>

Project GGC was created by developer Dieter Schultschik in year 2002 and was later abandoned (due to lack 
of time). Project was taken over by developer Andy (Aleksander) Rozman in year 2005. After that a lot of 
thing were changed (internationlization, database support, food database support, etc.), and also most
of visual part were changed, but main look stayed the same (except we now support several more Look &amp; 
Feels). Later we were joined by Reinhold Rumberger, who took over testing and also support for German 
language. Now we finally had first public release (0.3) and now we have several new devlopers, who will
help with development. If you feel like it, you can help us too, either with development, translation or
just testing of new features. All help is apreciated.<br>
<br>
<h2>Plugins</h2>
In 2008 we started thing about support for different hardware (glucose meters, pumps and other) and we
came to conclusion, that it would be better to make support for different hardware through so called 
plugins. Plugins were planned to have possibility to be run by themselves, but most of functionality 
can be achived only by working together with GGC. First plugin Meter Tool was created so that it could 
be used as seperate application, but all other plugins, lack this functionality (for now). Main idea of
plugin is that it can be developed separately from main GGC application, and with this making less 
problem for new developers.

<h2>Program mode</h2>
<strike>
With additional of next plugin (Pump plugin), we came across another problem. Meter data can be either 
written to main database (used for pen/injection) users or into database for pump users. So now user 
must select in which mode software works (by defualt it's Pen/Injection mode). All other functions that
are available in Pen context are also available under Pump context (graphs (different for both types) and 
ratio calcultation).
</strike>
 
<h2>About help</h2>
This help is <b>still work in progress</b>, meaning that a lot of help is still missing. We plan to have 
full help by next major release (0.5). For translation of help you will have to wait though. It could take
translators some time to translate help (and software).

<h2>Support</h2>
As we told before, this is open source software, so support is offered through several channels. You can 
get support by writing on list (on sourceforge.net, find link on out homepage), forum or by emailing us.
Email supported is handled through our external address: ggc@atech-software.com. Support is available in
English, German or Slovene.

<h2>Quick "How To"</h2>

As help is not there yet, here are quick pointers on How To get GGC up and running:<br>
1. Visit Tools\Preferences to set your name, and all other settings (go through all settings there)<br>
2. If you wish to use Bolus Helper, also set Ratio<br>
3. You are ready to go... <br>
