<h1>Backup/Restore System in GGC</h1>

GGC has special Backup/Restore mechanism, since all user data is stored in database. <br>
<br>
GGC uses Hibernate framework, which can use almost any Java database, so it is very
important that we have ability to do full Backup and Restore. (to make updates 
and to move data to and from various databases)<br>
<br>
As functionalities are enabled and used, also Backup options (Tables) are created so
that all used data can be easily preserved.<br>
<br>
All tables are versioned, so if there are changes in database, we can backup data and
restore it into new version (if we installed new version).<br>
<br>
Backup/Restore system is intended only for FULL backup/restore operations. <br>
<br>
With Daily Values we have option to just append data, but this just so that we can
also add data from other computers. At later time this functionality will be done by 
Export/Import system, which will be Backup/Restore subsystem.<br>
<br><br>
Currently we support backup of following data:
<ul>
<li>Daily Values for Pen/Injection theraphy</li>
<li>Configuration (full)</li>
<li>User Foods/Groups</li>
<li>Meals entries/Groups</li> 
<li>Pump data</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

Planned backup of following data:
<ul>
<li>Multi User Data (functionality not implemented yet)</li>
<li>USDA Food/Groups (now they are directly imported)</li>
<li>Home Weights and other food data (now they are directly imported)</li>
<li>CGMS data (CGMS support not started yet)</li>
</ul>
