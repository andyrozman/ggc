Hi !

In last few weeks I have been testing Dexcom G4 device (I have it till end of August) and I started to work on reading data from device... At this point it looks quite ok... But I came around one curiosity... Some of data is stored binary and some as Xml... Now with Xml I had no problem, but I am now starting with binary part...

Only problem I see that they have versioning of this binary objects... I know that some people have already tried doing this in other languages (I am doing this in Java and it will become part of my GNU Gluco Control project I am working on) so I am wondering how did other people solve this problem? Do you even support this... I hope any of Dexcom hackers is here around...
