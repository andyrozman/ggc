      basal patterns history. SmartPix doesn't show exact history of BP. We will try to make this work,
      but until SmartPix is extended/fixed so long code won't be 100%, which means possible losss of some
      BP history.

       |
       |- ggc
           |
           |-- pump
           |       data
           |       device
           |              roche
           |       gui
           |           config
           |       list                 (list)
           |       output               (outputing data)
           |       protocol             (protocol for communication)
           |       test                 (test stuff)

           |-- web                      (for displaying different pump (list)


    * most of base stuff is implemented (outputs for example, some base protocols, guis, configuration)
    * everything was copied from meter tools 0.2, most of stuff will need to be enchanched and changed, but
      base stuff is now here.
    * created plug in class for connection to GGC
