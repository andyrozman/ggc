MEDTRONIC (previously known as Minimed)
========================================

Medtronic is one of bigest manufacturers of Insulin pumps, but they are keeping their protocols under lock and
key, so all implementations (here and anywhere else) are merely experimental.


HISTORY IN GGC
---------------

We started with support in 2009, and I think we were one of the first projects having at least some support
at that time. After that we came to problem how to decode History data... Sometime later first project
trying to decode that information was born (Bewest's decoding-carelink). About year after I finally came back
trying to use what was discovered by Bewest...

But I had to start from zero, because at that time supported ComLink, was no longer available (and mine went kaput
(read dead)), so I had to again go and try to invent hot water...

I was lucky at that time that Nightscout project created Android-uploader, which I used to compare my implementation
against, so I got it working... So at that time code for History decoding was also implemented and gotten ready for
testing... Few months past and all OS disable all USB legacy support, which made my support for CareLink USB again
useless...

Now fast forward to 2017... I came accross Lennart Goedhart implementation of 600SeriesAndroidUploader... I got
permission to use it, which is now base for next implementation, support for Contour Next Link 1/2
(CNL for 5xx devices), and will be also base for 6xx implementation, which will probably come in 2018.



CURRENT STATUS
---------------

5xx Devices:  Not supported yet, working on support, planned for end 2017 (Core implementation and Pump support).
              CGMS in 2018, if we get Core and Pump running by end of 2017.

6xx Devices:  Not supported yet. Pump support planned for 2018.
