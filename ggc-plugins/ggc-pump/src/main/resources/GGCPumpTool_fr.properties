#  Please use this file as default language file. Do not try to translate
#  from any other files, since this is the Master language file. Create the
#  same header and specify application version number for easier changes at
#  later time.
#  Translations should be grouped by groups as specified here.
#  Older groups are done by packages, newer by logical name.

#
#  In brackets there are now tags which define urgency of some text beeing translated
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_1=Needed, urgent (Base functionality, options which will be used by user mostly)
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_2=Needed
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_3=Not used yet (in public releases)
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_4=In implementation
#
#    * - If tags also has *, then it means that this string can change regulary, last update is in []
#
#    If there are double brackets (( )) these elements are from old langauge file and shouldn't be translated
#    at this time.
#
#    Most of keywords are copies from Meter Plugin and some are from GGC, so most can be copied
#    from either of this locations.
