#  Please use this file as default language file. Do not try to translate 
#  from any other files, since this is the Master language file. Create the
#  same header and specify application version number for easier changes at 
#  later time.
#  Translations should be grouped by groups as specified here. 
#  Older groups are done by packages, newer by logical name.
# 
#  This part is intended for nutrition only, everything that is done 
#  by nutrition is here.
#
#  In data folder there is nutrition folder containg all untranslated words
#  for both: home weights and foods. If we want to achieve full translation
#  of nutrition database, then we need to translate all words. This will be 
#  done with time, but it's not priority at this time. So far most common [TODO] 
#
# 383
#
#  In brackets there are now tags which define urgency of some text beeing translated
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_1=Needed, urgent (dialogs)
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_2=Needed (this are mostly nutrients, home weight, which is probably nice to have translated)
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_3=Not so important, but nice to have

USDA_NUTRITION_DATABASE_DESC=<html><body>The USDA is the United States Department of Agriculture database containing lots of food used and sold in the US. Since this database is used all around the world, we decided to incorporate it here for the user to use. The version in the database is dependent on the files that were used for import. Versions 18 and higher are allowed (tested with SR-18).<br>In this module you can see all entries of this database, and if you started it from certain other modules (like Meals) you can select food and import them.</body></html>
USER_NUTRITION_DATABASE_DESC=<html><body>This is the nutrition database which the user can add entries to. At a later time we will support the import of foreign nutrition databases (which will then be editable), so you may take advantage of the extended folder structure (each folder can have subfolders). If, for example, you are from Germany, you can create a folder named &quot;German Foods&quot;, in which you then put differnt groups (e.g. Microwave ready, types of foods, manufacturer, etc).</body></html>
