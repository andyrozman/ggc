#  Please use this file as default language file. Do not try to translate 
#  from any other files, since this is the Master language file. Create the
#  same header and specify application version number for easier changes at 
#  later time.
#  Translations should be grouped by groups as specified here. 
#  Older groups are done by packages, newer by logical name.
# 
#  This part is intended for nutrition only, everything that is done 
#  by nutrition is here.
#
#  In data folder there is nutrition folder containg all untranslated words
#  for both: home weights and foods. If we want to achieve full translation
#  of nutrition database, then we need to translate all words. This will be 
#  done with time, but it's not priority at this time. So far most common [TODO] 
#

#
#  In brackets there are now tags which define urgency of some text beeing translated
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_1=Needed, urgent (dialogs)
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_2=Needed (this are mostly nutrients, home weight, which is probably nice to have translated)
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_3=Not so important, but nice to have
