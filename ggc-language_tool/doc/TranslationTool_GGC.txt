Translation Tool - Instruction for GGC 
=======================================


HOW TO GET FILES
=================

There are two ways of getting the new files:

A.) Wait for next language pack. 
    New language pack will be released about month before release. This is preferred way of 
    getting language updates. If you have already submitted your translation you will now
    get it back, with this file.  
     
B.) Get it from svn.
    If you have experience with SVN you can get correct files from GGC SVN. You will need 
    to get correct files from each project (*_en.properies).



HOW TO DEPLOY NEW TRANSLATION
==============================

After you are finished with translation, please send files to us (ggc@atech-software.com). 
We will then either copy them whole (in case that you are the only translator) or copy 
just entries that were changed. Please put Translation <your_language> in subject line. If 
you send the files even week before release, they will be also put into release.


HOW TO TEST
============
 
We are working on extending GGC so that you can test this files as you are translating it.
This is still work in progress, but it will work so.

a.) copy your translation files to GGC_Root\data\tools\translation. You will need to do
    this after each translation.
    
b.) copy config\TranslationGGC.config file to GGC_Root\data\tools\translation and edit
    it. (You will need to do this only once).
    
c.) In Preferences\General, you will amongst options also have option Translation Tool 
    (or in future text you specified in configuration from step b) as LANGUAGE_NAME),
    which will then take correct files.
    
NOTE: This functionality is implemented, and will be available after you update GGC to 0.4.20
    update (planned release June 2010).
