
GGC - GNU Gluco Control
=======================

This are short instructions on how to start the application. As prerequisite you need to have java 5
or higher installed (java 6 is preferred if available). If java is correctly installed (and in 
your path) you shouldn't have any problems (you can check this by typing 'java -version' in command 
prompt - shell, if you get result it should work, if you get file not found, then there will be
problems...)



A) How to start software
=========================

1.) Windows
After install program should run by itself (by clicking on icon), if it doesn't, you will need to 
troubleshoot. Run cmd.exe (command line shell, search for icon Command Prompt) and run following
command: run_win.cmd. Error should be written somewhere on screen. 
In most cases problem is with java path ('java' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file). In this case follow instructions under C): 1.


2.) Linux
On linux platform you need to issue following command 'sh run_linux.sh'. If application doesn't start
see on screen where the problem is. 
Same as in Windows section (A.1) in most cases problem is with java path (see section C.1. on how to 
resolve this)


3.) MacOS X
On MacOS X platform you need to issue following command 'bash run_mac.sh'. If application doesn't
start see on screen where the problem is. 
Same as in Windows section (A.1) in most cases problem is with java path (see section C.1. on how to 
resolve this)


4.) Other
Unsupported, see section C.) 2.



B) Support for Meters, Pumps and CGMS (serial and serial-usb bridge communication)
==================================================================================

We added support for Meters and we use special library called RxTX, for access to serial port (or USB
bridge). 

If you have special OS, which is not supported contact us on: ggc@atech-software.com. This library needs
special binary part. You need to either find this binary part for RxTX library (someone else might have 
already made it) or build it yourself (www.rxtx.org has source files, and library is open source).

Binary library files need to be put into lib\native directory. Under that you have separate directories, 
which are platform short names (linux, win, ...). All supported short names are listed under section D.  

Supported OSes at this time are: Windows (x32, works with x64), Solaris (32/64), Mac OS X, Linux (x32, 
ia64, x64).

If you have USB device, you should configure USB so, that it will show virtual COM port.



C) Troubleshooting
===================

1.) Java Path is not correct
----------------------------

a) Change path in StartupConfig

Open StartupConfig.properties with your favorite editor. Change JAVA_EXE parameter to point to your java 
executable (if you have Windows you should enclose path in " ", so that whole path is used. Also if you 
use \, you should use doubles (\\), like "c:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre_1.5.0_06\\bin\\java.exe". When 
this file is read single \ are removed.

There is now also another way. You can create separate StartupConfig files for different platforms. Files
then look like StartupConfig_<platform short name>.properties. This is helpful if you plan to use same 
instalation under several OSes (for example on multi-os-startup machine or usb drive). USB How-to and 
VMs will be available shortly.


b) Change path in startup file (see section D)

Open startup file and change path to java, similar to change in C.1.a, but here you must use single \ instead
of double (like: "c:\Program Files\Java\jre_1.5.0_06\bin\java.exe")


2.) Unsupported OS
If you have reached this section then you have unsupported system. In this case you need to contact us at:
ggc@atech-software.com. If possible, we will need your help to make your OS supported. Don't worry, it
won't take long time to make your OS supported. Usually there are just minor changes to do... Bigger problem
might be creation of binary file for RxTX (see section B.).



D) Startup file
================

For each platform we have different batch startup file: 

Platform    |    Batch file    |  Short name  |  Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows     |  run_win.cmd     |  win         |
Linux       |  run_linux.sh    |  linux       | need to have sh installed (usually installed by default)
Mac         |  run_mac.sh      |  mac         | need to have bash installed (usually installed by default)
