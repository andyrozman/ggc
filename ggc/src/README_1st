
GGC - GNU Gluco Control
=======================

This are short instructions on how to start the application.

All java programs need special environment to run, it's called Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or 
Java Development Kit (JDK, it contains JRE). On some OSes we can have problems detecting if this 
JRE or JDK is installed. Because of this most of software packages, also contain JRE in their 
install package (we have one windows install package that also contains JRE).

For GGC you need to have at least Java 1.5, but 1.6 is preferred. 

Problem is that this JRE is different for each platform (also for each hardware version of platform),
so we need to do some things, to make GGC to run.
You can choose to do one of these things:

1.) Modify system path to include path to your existing JRE installation. 
    You can check if this is set if you run following command 'java -version'. If you get 
    'file not found' error then this is not set.

2.) Copy JRE files into jre directory under GGC 
    Now you have two options here. If you have java already installed on your system (your 
    browser sometimes install this automatically to handle java applets) you can copy the
    files from there. Usually they are under C:\Program Files\Java\jre<version> on windows
    and somewhere under /usr/local/java on linux. You need to copy all files under jre<something>
    directory to <GGC-Installed>\jre directory.
    2nd option is to download correct VM from 'USB Release' section. This is file that is meant
    for installation to USB disks (coming soon). All tested VMs are there, so if you find 
    VM there you should not have any problems. You need to download VM zip file and extract 
    certain files. In the archive you will find a directory with the name of the VM (in case of windows,
    directory is called Windows) under that directory there is jre_<version><OS-tags> directory. 
    Copy all files under there into GGC\jre directory. If your OSes VM is not there, then you 
    will have to use the one installed on system. 
        
3.) Modify config files  
    How to modify config files is described in section C.), but please read also through 
    sections A) and B)  



A) How to start software
=========================

1.) Windows
After install program should run by itself (by clicking on icon), if it doesn't, you will need to 
troubleshoot. Run cmd.exe (command line shell, search for icon Command Prompt) and run following
command: run_win.cmd. Error should be written somewhere on screen. 
In most cases problem is with java path ('java' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file). In this case follow instructions under C): 1.


2.) Linux
On linux platform you need to issue following command 'sh run_linux.sh'. If application doesn't start
see on screen where the problem is. 
Same as in Windows section (A.1) in most cases problem is with java path (see section C.1. on how to 
resolve this)


3.) MacOS X
On MacOS X platform you need to issue following command 'bash run_mac.sh'. If application doesn't
start see on screen where the problem is. 
Same as in Windows section (A.1) in most cases problem is with java path (see section C.1. on how to 
resolve this)


4.) Other
Unsupported, see section C.) 2.



B) Support for Meters, Pumps and CGMS (serial and serial-usb bridge communication)
==================================================================================

We added support for Meters and we use special library called RxTX, for access to serial port (or USB
bridge). 

If you have special OS, which is not supported contact us on: ggc@atech-software.com. This library needs
special binary part. You need to either find this binary part for RxTX library (someone else might have 
already made it) or build it yourself (www.rxtx.org has source files, and library is open source).

Binary library files need to be put into lib\native directory. Under that you have separate directories, 
which are platform short names (linux, win, ...). All supported short names are listed under section D.  

Supported OSes at this time are: Windows (x32, works with x64), Solaris (32/64), Mac OS X, Linux (x32, 
ia64, x64).

If you have USB device, you should configure USB so, that it will show virtual COM port.



C) Troubleshooting
===================

1.) Java Path is not correct
----------------------------

a) Change path in StartupConfig

Open StartupConfig.properties with your favorite editor. Change JAVA_EXE parameter to point to your java 
executable (if you have Windows you should enclose path in " ", so that whole path is used. Also if you 
use \, you should use doubles (\\), like "c:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre_1.5.0_06\\bin\\java.exe". When 
this file is read single \ are removed.

There is now also another way. You can create separate StartupConfig files for different platforms. Files
then look like StartupConfig_<platform short name>.properties. This is helpful if you plan to use same 
installation under several OSes (for example on Multi-OS-Startup machine or USB drive). USB How-to and 
VMs (Java Virtual Machine for specified OS and needed config files) will be available shortly.


b) Change path in startup file (see section D)

Open startup file and change path to java (JAVA_EXE variable), similar to change in D.1.a, but here you 
must use single \ instead of double (like: "c:\Program Files\Java\jre_1.5.0_06\bin\java.exe")


2.) Unsupported OS
-------------------

If you have reached this section then you have unsupported system. In this case you need to contact us at:
ggc@atech-software.com. If possible, we will need your help to make your OS supported. Don't worry, it
won't take long time to make your OS supported. Usually there are just minor changes to do... Bigger problem
might be creation of binary file for RxTX (see section B.).



D) Supported platforms
=======================

Platform    |   Startup file   |  Short name  |  Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows     |  run_win.cmd     |  win         |
Linux       |  run_linux.sh    |  linux       | need to have sh installed (usually installed by default)
Mac         |  run_mac.sh      |  mac         | need to have bash installed (usually installed by default)
FreeBSD     |  run_freebsd.sh  |  freebsd     | need to have sh installed (installed by default)
