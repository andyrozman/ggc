
GNU Gluco Control (GGC)
=======================

1. ABOUT
========

Welcome to GNU Gluco Control (GGC). GGC is an open-source java application,
intended to help you manage your diabetes. Open-source means that the
application is freely available, together with its source code, which means
that anybody can help with development.

Since this is open-source, errors (geeks call them bugs) can occur during the
operation of the application. For this we apologize... Since we are diabetics
ourselves, we are trying to make this software the best it can be, but as you
know, accidents happen. Please read through this document to find out how
this software can become better, with a little help from your side (you don't have
to be developer to help, each reported problem can help us bring GGC closer to
perfection).

If you want to help develop or officially test this software, please read the
companion document 'How_I_Can_Help.txt'. The same document is required reading for
developers.


2. CURRENT VERSION AND STATUS
=============================

This is version 0.3 of GGC.

At this point we are at version 0.3, which is the first public release. If you
installed any version prior to that, please uninstall. This version has the
ability to update itself when a new version is available.

This first public release can only use the internal database. If you have 
little above average computer knowledge (read 'if you like to dabble'), you can 
try to make it work with any database (see file 'How_I_Can_Help.txt') with just a 
little work.

New (major) releases are planned to occur in 6 month intervals. This means that
you can expect release 0.4 by the end of this year (or start of the next one).

A minor release will be done, when functionality has been change in such a way
that it is beneficial to user to be released (major functionality changes and
bug fixes)

For now you need to update files manually, which means exactly following the
instructions supplied with the release (there will be a file called
'How To Upgrade.txt' supplied with each upgrade release).
 



3. WHAT FUNCTIONALITY IS AVAILABLE
==================================

- Adding Daily data about insulin, BG entries, activity, urine, comments
- Display graphs for this daily data (still work in progress)
- Food databases for "Carb Counting": USDA Nutrition DB, User Nutrition DB
  and Meals database
- Printing reports
- Update mechanism (client side only), this means that until the server side
  of update is done, you won't be able to update, but as soon as that works
  you will have the option to update.   
- Backup mechanism (restore is still in the works)



4. PLANNED FUNCTIONALITY
========================


Version 0.4
------------
- Automatic DB Update
= Restore data (previously backed-up)
- DB Tool (for using other databases and install of initial data)
- Multi person instance
- Finalization of GGC Little, which is used as a resident application for adding
  new data throughout the day
- GGC PPC - the version of the application to be used by the Pocket PC (not all the
  functionality of the full version will be available)
- Update mechanism (server side)   
- Integration of Meter Tool (Meter Tool is being developed as a separate project)
- Appointments (adding appointment, adding data from doctor's visit), Doctors
  management (adding)
- Medical stock - Listing of everything that patient has, and what he needs to
  get to handle diabetes (and also any other condition)
- Fully write help files and add help through application (English version so far)


Version 0.5
------------
- Export/Import Management
- Export/Import data
- GGC Network (running several instances of GGC on several computers)
- Synchronization (for GGC network)
- Links to data about diabetes on internet
- Pump Tool integration



5. SUB-PROJECTS
===============

Currently there are two sub-projects running.


METER-TOOL
-----------

This is a plug-in for getting data from glucose meters. Currently this project is in
the development phase. Together with support for Ascensia meters, we are finishing
up the whole plug-in framework and all needed graphical interface forms (classes).
The first alpha version will be available around September 2008, together with the
finished implementation for Ascensia meters. Next in line are Roche meters
(December 2008) and after them LifeScan meters (January 2009).


PUMP-TOOL
----------

This is plug-in for entering and retrieving data from insulin pumps. This project
is still in the planning phase. The project will move into the development phase
in September 2008, so the next version (0.4) may already have part of the pump-tool
functionality. The first supported pumps will be those from Roche (April 2009),
after them probably Minimed.



6. HOW CAN I HELP AS REGULAR USER
==================================

There are several ways you can help. The first and major way is to test software.
Try to use it and find anything that doesn't work. Version 0.3 will be started from
the command-line and all actions will also be displayed in the console. If you see
an error text, exception or e.g. many cryptic lines of classes with numbers, this
means something went wrong. The error is displayed on your screen, but it is also
logged to a file (in <GGC_Root>\data\log). There you will find one or more files for
each day. If an error happened today, there will be a file named 'GGC.log'. You need
to open it and go to end and try to find the previously displayed errors.
Zip this file and store it. And do the following (choose option A or B):

A.) Visit the bug reporting site for our project and enter the bug by yourself.
   Please attach the zipped log. The site is (data should be entered in English):
   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49749&atid=457319  
   You don't need to be member at sourceforge to add this information, if you are
   not please, write your email address somewhere in the error report. Describe
   exactly what you were doing when the exception occurred and how the problem
   affected your application. Also please let us know the configuration of your
   computer (for example: Celereon 2000 with 2 Gb Ram, running Ubuntu Linux,
   kernel 2.4.1.34, with java 1.6_06)

B.) Send us an email (ggc@atech-software.com), with all the data described in A).

---

If everything works OK on your system, we still ask you to send us logs. Every month
or so, please zip all log files (you can remove them from the log directory) and
send them to ggc@atech-software.com.

We will use some tool to look through all files and see if there was some error
which has gone undiscovered by you and will try to fix it.

---

So you have been using the software for some time, some things work fine, other not
so well. If you find parts of GGC, which your think could work better, please let us
know. If you find that some functionality is missing, again, let us know. You can
use either email, or you can use the following form (data should be entered in
English):
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49749&atid=457322

---

We will try to fix problems as soon as possible, but since there are only two of us
(three, but only two active) it might take some time... Major bugs will be fixed
first, then the minor ones...
New functionality proposals have the lowest priority (and planned functionality has
priority).

Maybe some new developers will now join us and help us with further development of
this application.




7. END
=======


Again, thank you for using our software, we hope it fulfills your needs... If not
yet, maybe in the future.
