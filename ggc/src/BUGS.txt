Know Bugs:

    - [sf] german translation is somewhat behind schedule
    - [sf] changes made to "medical data" don't get applied to "Colors & Fonts" until dialog is re-opened
      A: changes are saved on exit of dialog... I guess we have to change that.
    - this is a general problem whenever a static layout is used, but german strings 
      tend to be a bit longer that their english counterparts, resulting in a lot of 
      truncated strings
      A: We need to discover which labels have problems and make them bigger if 
      possible. If it can't be done abbrev. must be used. We don't actually use
      static layout... I use null layout, because most of java's layouts are 
      unpredictable
      R: So, how's null layout not java's static layout? I know about their
      unpredictability (boy, do I!), but they at least adapt sizes to fit the contents
      A: They are too unpredictable for my test, so we will stay with static for now. If string is too big it will be
        cut off
    - The code relies on there being at least one entry per day; days without entries will be ignored in the date range selection code, resulting
      in the GlucoValues passed to CourseGraphView.setGlucoValues() containing only one day if there is only one value in the database, even  if
      a larger range was selected. (The problem lies in GlucoValues.getDayCount(), see FIXME-comment)
    - When entering BG, CH, insulin data, negative values can be entered. Negative BG gets set to 0 without warning. BTW: they don't get drawn,
      but that doesn't excuse them being accepted!
      (We're great! We make it possible for people to puke, squeeze insulin from their fat tissue and even live with no sugar at all in their bloodstream!)
    - Setting a colour for one "color scheme" will change it for the rest, too.
    - Restore: Browse dialog should open in ../data/export
    - Restore: Description on first windows is little "off" on FreeBSD
    - I18n TAGS missing: EDIT_FOOD_GROUP
    - GI/GL not implemented
    - Daily Food Selector has problem when selecting meals... not all nutrients are displayed
    - Statistics for Main Screen invalid for BG
    - Statistics for Daily Value Stats invalid for BG  


Not A Bug:
    - "New Entry" dialog should only contain one of mg/dl and mmol/l Fields, 
      depending on preferences.
      * This is not a bug. It's feature 
        * It was a bug before the other field was updated when one lost focus
    - If e.g. the USDA DB is opened, GGC won't react to a "Close" command from the task bar (at least in KDE)
      A: This must be internal problem with KDE. Dialogs are set to be modal, this works ok with windows
      A: This is confirmed as KDE problem. Problem is solved with KDE 5 at least I think it is.


Bugs fixed in version X:

0.3.x
    - when a settings change could not be propagated to the database (sql exception 
      or whatever), the changes are still applied to GGC, but obviously can't be 
      loaded from the DB on startup; the behaviour in this case should be as if the 
      user had selected "Cancel"
      A: When there is problem with database, program shouldn't even start... This is fixed in new version only
         requirement is that you use our startup scripts (run_<os_name>), they call special checker that 
         creates info file, which is read by GGC on start
    - After data was entered (DailyStatsDialog, etc.), it will be appended to the table instead of being inserted where it belongs.
      A: This was fixed, at least for DailyStatsDialog


0.2.16
    - GGC Little: meters button is unresponsive
    - GGC Little: About button is static (problematic when size is changed)
    - GGCLittle -> (no data in DB) New Entry -> the following message:
0 year: 200 month: 85 day: 21  hour: 0 min: 0
Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 84

0.2.15.1
    - Backup without anything selected will cause a ZipException
    - Slovene translation is done


0.2.12:
    - [sf] changing time in entry will not re-order cells
    - [sf] Entering plain text in numerical only fields should at least result in a warning (is ignored, and the numerical value is set to 0)
    - Add Entry -> Edit Food -> Add -> Cancel will still attempt to add something

0.2.9.9:
    - months not translated !!
      Andy: fixed
    - [sf] mmol values are rounded to ints, which does not make sense
      Andy: all BG values are saved as mg/dl format (in db), so they aren't rounded,
         they are converted        
    - [sf] Title for spread graph suggests a lost key in GGC_*.properties
      Andy: fixed
    - [sf] "DAILY_CONTROL", "SHOW_DAILY_GRAPH" and "DAILY_VALUES" missing in GGC Little
      Andy: added
    - [sf] switching L&F from CDE/Motif to SkinLF doesn't result in settings being saved : can't reproduce, you must 
           click on OK to save changes... IS THIS STILL THERE? (see sf)
      Andy: fixed
    - HbA1c-Frame: "your current HbA1c" is right-aligned, which looks crappy
      Andy: total change of this dialog.

0.2.x.x:
    - L&F loading is inconsistent (makes a hardcoded assumption where themepacks are stored) and currently fails
      on Linux (and probably because of that) -- You need to have files in specified directory,
      which is ../data/skinlf_themes/ - Andy
    - at least one undiscovered infinite loop, can't reproduce, happened while the preferences frame was open (found by: developer rumbi)
      (not sure whether/how this was fixed, but since I haven't seen this in ages, and pretty much everything 
      has been changed, I guess this was fixed along the way)
    - infinite loop when trying to display hba1c without data (rumbi): can't reproduce, looks ok. (andy)
      (same as above)

0.2.9.3
    - division by zero when displaying graphs without data (RR)

0.2.5.3:
    - In Preferences->General: changing language also changes selected L&F name, but not class
    - Changed preferences mostly apply only after restart (names, language)
    - hba1c of 2.09% with ZERO readings...

0.2.4.2:
    - graphs axis: labels should start at 0, not 4 (works for mg/dl but not mmol/l)
      (NOTE: seems to have been a rounding error due to using ints)
