
PRE-INSTALLATION NOTE
======================

This document applies to all updates after version 0.3.1. 

In our release version 0.3, we had small problem in backup methods (present in atech-tools). Because of this 
you need to apply update 0.3.1 on original 0.3 installation, before proceeding with any further update (you 
don't need to apply each update that was released, you only need to apply update 0.3.1 and after that latest 
update there is). How to apply update 0.3.1 is described in zip file for this update.



How To Upgrade
===============


At this point our application has no ability to make automatic upgrades. Because of this all updates need 
to be applied manually.

Problem with all database applications is that we need to make update to application and to database. In each
update package there will be file, with all releases listed and version of database they use. Depending on
information found there you will select which upgrade way to go. (difference is in step 2)


HOW ARE UPDATE FILES PACKAGED
=============================

Update files contain this document (in future in all supported languages), file database_info.txt, with database
information and Changes_<version>.txt (this is condensed version of Changes.txt document in SVN). Next there are 
directories that you need to update. There will be at least two directories there, sometimes three. 
   - data: contains update file, which tells us which versions we are currently using (this is used to 
       generate startup files, when you run run_<os_name>.<os_ext> batch script). 
   - libs: contains all libraries and our software
   - bin: contains script
   - docs: contains this documentation
   
How to apply this update will be shown in few steps. Please follow them to the letter.



STEP 1: Create backup copy of your data
----------------------------------------

Start GNU Gluco Control and wait for it to load, then go to Tools -> Database Maintainance -> Database backup.

In next window select all object and click on backup. New backup file will be created in data\export
directory (GGC backup <year>_<month>_<day> <hour>_<minute>_<second>). Copy it to same safe location.

Close GNU Gluco Control.



STEP 2: Create backup copy of application
------------------------------------------

Open your favorite File manager and create directory somewhere (probably something like
GGC_Backup_<current_date>). Copy whole GGC instalation there (it should have at least bin, lib and data
subdirectories, sometime also jre). Copy all of them. 

This copy will be used in case that something goes wrong in next steps.



STEP 3: Make actual update
---------------------------

Please take a look at database_info.txt file. You need to compare last entry (current version) and version
you have installed (it is displayed in title bar when you start application). If the versions are the same
go to step 3A if not step 3B.


STEP 3.A: Update with same version
-----------------------------------

Use File manager (I advise to use some that has integrated Zip archiver, like Total commander) and open archive 
file, you need to copy everything into your instalation directory. You will be asked to overwrite some files, 
you need to overwrite all files there.  
 

STEP 3.B: Update with different version
----------------------------------------

1. Do all actions in STEP 3.A

2. Run run_<os_name>.<os_extension>. Application will display some errors, this is OK. We needed to run this 
   script just to recreate startup script. Close application as soon as you can.
   
3. Now you have new scripts. You need to run init_db.<os_extension> which will recreate database



STEP 4: Start new version of application
-----------------------------------------

Start application, which should now start without problems.


STEP 4.A: Starting with same version 
-------------------------------------

When application is started you should have all your data there, since we didn't do any changes to
our database


STEP 4.B: Starting with different version
------------------------------------------

Now when application is started there will be no data available anymore. Database was totally recreated 
(and also deleted), so it's "clean" now. You will have to do following to get your data back. Click on
Tools -> Database Maintainance -> Backup Restore. Select file you created in step 1 and in next window
select all objects and click on Restore. After restart all your data should be there. 


STEP 5: Finished
-----------------

Update is finished.
