How To Upgrade
===============


At this point our application has no ability to make automatic upgrades. Because of this all updates need to be applied 
manually.

Problem with all database applications is that we need to make update to application and to database. Because of this 
our updates have special tag in name (for example db_v5). You need to look into README file to determine which version 
of database update needs. In our application there is option to backup database (Tools->Database Maintainance->Backup).
At this point Restore option is not available, but it will be available in one of our first updates. We will change 
this document accordingly.  

According to database tag, you have now two options of update. (see A, B)
