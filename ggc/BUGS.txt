Know Bugs:

    - [sf] german translation is somewhat behind schedule
    - Slovene translation is also somewhat behind schedule
    - [sf] changes made to "medical data" don't get applied to "Colors & Fonts" until dialog is re-opened
      A: changes are saved on exit of dialog... I guess we have to change that.
    - [sf] Entering plain text in numerical only fields should at least result in a warning (is ignored, and the numerical value is set to 0)
    - GGC Little: meters button is unresponsive
    - GGC Little: About button is static (problematic when size is changed)
    - [sf] changing time in entry will not re-order cells
    

Bugs fixed in version X:

0.2.9.9:
    - months not translated !!
      Andy: fixed
    - [sf] mmol values are rounded to ints, which does not make sense
      Andy: all BG values are saved as mg/dl format (in db), so they aren't rounded,
         they are converted        
    - [sf] Title for spread graph suggests a lost key in GGC_*.properties
      Andy: fixed
    - [sf] "DAILY_CONTROL", "SHOW_DAILY_GRAPH" and "DAILY_VALUES" missing in GGC Little
      Andy: added
    - [sf] switching L&F from CDE/Motif to SkinLF doesn't result in settings being saved : can't reproduce, you must 
           click on OK to save changes... IS THIS STILL THERE? (see sf)
      Andy: fixed
    - HbA1c-Frame: "your current HbA1c" is right-aligned, which looks crappy
      Andy: total change of this dialog.

0.2.x.x:
    - L&F loading is inconsistent (makes a hardcoded assumption where themepacks are stored) and currently fails
      on Linux (and probably because of that) -- You need to have files in specified directory,
      which is ../data/skinlf_themes/ - Andy
    - at least one undiscovered infinite loop, can't reproduce, happened while the preferences frame was open (found by: developer rumbi)
      (not sure whether/how this was fixed, but since I haven't seen this in ages, and pretty much everything 
      has been changed, I guess this was fixed along the way)
    - infinite loop when trying to display hba1c without data (rumbi): can't reproduce, looks ok. (andy)
      (same as above)

0.2.9.3
    - division by zero when displaying graphs without data (RR)

0.2.5.3:
    - In Preferences->General: changing language also changes selected L&F name, but not class
    - Changed preferences mostly apply only after restart (names, language)
    - hba1c of 2.09% with ZERO readings...

0.2.4.2:
    - graphs axis: labels should start at 0, not 4 (works for mg/dl but not mmol/l)
      (NOTE: seems to have been a rounding error due to using ints)
