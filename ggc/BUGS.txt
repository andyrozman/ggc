Know Bugs:

    - L&F loading is inconsistent (makes a hardcoded assumption where themepacks are stored) and currently fails
      on Linux (and probably because of that)
    - at least one undiscovered infinite loop, can't repsoduce, happened while the preferences frame was open (found by: developer rumbi)
    - infinite loop when trying to display hba1c without data (rumbi): can't reproduce, looks ok. (andy)
    - division by zero when displaying graphs without data
    - german translation is somewhat behind schedule
    - switching L&F from CDE/Motif to SkinLF doesn't result in settings being saved : can't reproduce, you must 
      click on OK to save changes...

Bugs fixed in version X:

0.2.5.3:
    - In Preferences->General: changing language also changes selected L&F name, but not class
    - Changed preferences mostly apply only after restart (names, language)
    - hba1c of 2.09% with ZERO readings...


0.2.4.2:
    - graphs axis: labels should start at 0, not 4 (works for mg/dl but not mmol/l)
      (NOTE: seems to have been a rounding error due to using ints)
