Know Bugs:

    - [sf] german translation is somewhat behind schedule
    - Slovene translation is also somewhat behind schedule
    - [sf] changes made to "medical data" don't get applied to "Colors & Fonts" until dialog is re-opened
      A: changes are saved on exit of dialog... I guess we have to change that.
    - [sf] Entering plain text in numerical only fields should at least result in a warning (is ignored, and the numerical value is set to 0)
    - GGC Little: meters button is unresponsive
    - GGC Little: About button is static (problematic when size is changed)
    - [sf] changing time in entry will not re-order cells
    - when a settings change could not be propagated to the database (sql exception or whatever), the changes are still applied to GGC, but
      obviously can't be loaded from the DB on startup; the behaviour in this case should be as if the user had selected "Cancel"
    - "New Entry" dialog should only contain one of mg/dl and mmol/l Fields, depending on preferences
    - this is a general problem whenever a static layout is used, but german strings tend to be a bit longer that their english counterparts,
      resulting in a lot of truncated strings
    - The code relies on there being at least one entry per day; days without entries will be ignored in the date range selection code, resulting
      in the GlucoValues passed to CourseGraphView.setGlucoValues() containing only one day if there is only one value in the database, even  if
      a larger range was selected. (The problem lies in GlucoValues.getDayCount(), see FIXME-comment)
    - Backup without anything selected will cause a ZipException


Bugs fixed in version X:

0.2.9.9:
    - months not translated !!
      Andy: fixed
    - [sf] mmol values are rounded to ints, which does not make sense
      Andy: all BG values are saved as mg/dl format (in db), so they aren't rounded,
         they are converted        
    - [sf] Title for spread graph suggests a lost key in GGC_*.properties
      Andy: fixed
    - [sf] "DAILY_CONTROL", "SHOW_DAILY_GRAPH" and "DAILY_VALUES" missing in GGC Little
      Andy: added
    - [sf] switching L&F from CDE/Motif to SkinLF doesn't result in settings being saved : can't reproduce, you must 
           click on OK to save changes... IS THIS STILL THERE? (see sf)
      Andy: fixed
    - HbA1c-Frame: "your current HbA1c" is right-aligned, which looks crappy
      Andy: total change of this dialog.

0.2.x.x:
    - L&F loading is inconsistent (makes a hardcoded assumption where themepacks are stored) and currently fails
      on Linux (and probably because of that) -- You need to have files in specified directory,
      which is ../data/skinlf_themes/ - Andy
    - at least one undiscovered infinite loop, can't reproduce, happened while the preferences frame was open (found by: developer rumbi)
      (not sure whether/how this was fixed, but since I haven't seen this in ages, and pretty much everything 
      has been changed, I guess this was fixed along the way)
    - infinite loop when trying to display hba1c without data (rumbi): can't reproduce, looks ok. (andy)
      (same as above)

0.2.9.3
    - division by zero when displaying graphs without data (RR)

0.2.5.3:
    - In Preferences->General: changing language also changes selected L&F name, but not class
    - Changed preferences mostly apply only after restart (names, language)
    - hba1c of 2.09% with ZERO readings...

0.2.4.2:
    - graphs axis: labels should start at 0, not 4 (works for mg/dl but not mmol/l)
      (NOTE: seems to have been a rounding error due to using ints)
