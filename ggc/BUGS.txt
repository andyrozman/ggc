Know Bugs:

    - at least one undiscovered infinite loop, can't reproduce, happened while the preferences frame was open (found by: developer rumbi)
    - infinite loop when trying to display hba1c without data (rumbi): can't reproduce, looks ok. (andy)
    - german translation is somewhat behind schedule
    - switching L&F from CDE/Motif to SkinLF doesn't result in settings being saved : can't reproduce, you must 
      click on OK to save changes... IS THIS STILL THERE?
    - changes made to "medical data" don't get applied to "Colors & Fonts" until dialog is re-opened
    - Title for spread graph suggests a lost key in GGC_*.properties
    - HbA1c-Frame: "your current HbA1c" is right-aligned, which looks crappy
    - Entering plain text in numerical only fields should at least result in a warning (is ignored, and the numerical value is set to 0)
    - "DAILY_CONTROL", "SHOW_DAILY_GRAPH" and "DAILY_VALUES" missing in GGC Little
    - GGC Little: meters button is unresponsive
    - GGC Little: About button is static (problematic when size is changed)

Bugs fixed in version X:

0.2.x.x:
    - L&F loading is inconsistent (makes a hardcoded assumption where themepacks are stored) and currently fails
      on Linux (and probably because of that) -- You need to have files in specified directory,
      which is ../data/skinlf_themes/ - Andy

0.2.9.3
    - division by zero when displaying graphs without data (RR)

0.2.5.3:
    - In Preferences->General: changing language also changes selected L&F name, but not class
    - Changed preferences mostly apply only after restart (names, language)
    - hba1c of 2.09% with ZERO readings...

0.2.4.2:
    - graphs axis: labels should start at 0, not 4 (works for mg/dl but not mmol/l)
      (NOTE: seems to have been a rounding error due to using ints)
