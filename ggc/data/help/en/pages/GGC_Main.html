Help is not available yet. Framework is created and implemented, but we still need to write all help pages. This is planned for version 0.4.<br>
<br>
Quick How-To:<br>
1. Go to "Tools\Preferences" and set all preferences that you think that you need to change.<br>
2. Use BGs\Daily to add daily values<br>
3. If you set "Printing" in Preferences you can also print everything... <br>
<br><br>
Everything else is still in development... You can use graphs, but most of them still have some problems.<br>
<br><br>
Last added functionality is Foods... here you have three types of databases for foods and meals... This is fully functional... You can add foods in User Database and create meals in Meals database... Data created here can then 
be used to "import" into Daily Values and CH is extracted from it (for Carb Counting)<br><br>
