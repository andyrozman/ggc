#  Please use this file as default language file. Do not try to translate 
#  from any other files, since this is the Master language file. Create the
#  same header and specify application version number for easier changes at 
#  later time.
#  Translations should be grouped by groups as specified here. 
#  Older groups are done by packages, newer by logical name.
# 
#  This part is intended for nutrition only, everything that is done 
#  by nutrition is here.
#
#  In data folder there is nutrition folder containg all untranslated words
#  for both: home weights and foods. If we want to achieve full translation
#  of nutrition database, then we need to translate all words. This will be 
#  done with time, but it's not priority at this time. So far most common 
#
#  Collation Rules - In unicode we can create special rules for sorting where we specify
#     sorting order of special characters. This will be used by tree's and special tables.
#     For english this is left empty. For all other (that have non-standarn, non english
#     charcters) we need to set this if we want sorting to be done correctly.

USDA_NUTRITION_DATABASE_DESC=<html><body>USDA is United States Department of Agriculture database of lots of nutritions used and sold in US. Since this database is used all arround the world we decided to incormporate it here for user to use. Version in database is dependent on files that were used for import. Version of 18 and higher are allowed (tested with SR-18).<br>In this module you can see all entries into database, and if you started it from Meals module you can select nutrition you need to import into Meals Db.</body></html>
USER_NUTRITION_DATABASE=User Nutrition Database
USER_NUTRITION_DATABASE_DESC=<html><body>This is nutrition database in which user can add entries by him/her-self. At later time we will support import of foreign nutrition databases (which will be then editable), so you might take advantage of extended folder structure (each folder can have subfolders). So for example if you are from Germany, you can create folder German Foods, under which I put then differnt groups (Microwave ready.. etc) or types of foods or maybe manufacturer. </body></html>
