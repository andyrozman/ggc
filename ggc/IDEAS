I: Two kinds of insulin seems a bit minimalistic

A: All data tables, which could have additional parameters were added and extended column
   of type text (unlimited size - string), which allows us to add data, if data is present,
   so for example we could add third insulin option, but for time beeing 2 insulins are what
   is mostly used for insulin treatment. If someone nneed more than two insulins
   we only need to add code to change GUI. (Andy)

I: Pump and CGM support

A: Pump support is in plan. When I get a pump, then some type of support will
   be added. At start probably just manual entry (by end of 2008) and at later 
   time also reading data from pump. Support will be added for pump companies, 
   which will help us with providing protocol for communication.  
   If users will supply log of communication, it will be possible even 
   without this protocols. (Andy)
   
   As for CGM... no support planned at this moment... (Andy)
