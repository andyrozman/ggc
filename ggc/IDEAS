 * How about putting the languages in XML files. This would make formatting easier and allow
   for the use of dedicated XML editors. Does anybody by any chance have an idea how this
   could be implemented
   
Yes and this looks like you are trying to invent hot water. Bundle files are a very fine 
idea for languages beacuse they are simple, and easy changed. Look at the mess M$ made 
with C# and language files. If you would use XML you would then have to implement all 
things yourself, and make things harder for us developers. Now anybody can take language 
file and translates it himself, or adds keywords or does anything he wants with it. Why 
would you want to use XMLs anyway? It doesn't nothing good. Langauge files in 95% don't 
need any formating, plus in 5% they do, it wouldn't work in XML, since you can't use tags
in XMLs. Plus you would have to process this files before use.

Gee, it was a *thought*, not even an intention. :-)
A couple of responses:
 * I have so no idea about all this C#/.Net stuff, I couldn't even begin to see what you
   mean here
 * I was hoping for some pre-existing package,
 * The main point was really having decent editors available, as opposed to no proper editor
   for java properties files.
 * The one thing that really get's under my skin about java properties is the fact that
   you basically have to use ascii+unicode escapes to get special characters, whereas you
   could specify encoding in XML
 * OK, idea scrapped, I'd still like to do something about the previous point, though
