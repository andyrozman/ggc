I: Two kinds of insulin seems a bit minimalistic

A: All data tables, which could have additional parameters were added and extended column
   of type text (unlimited size - string), which allows us to add data, if data is present,
   so for example we could add third insulin option, but for time beeing 2 insulins are what
   is mostly used for insulin treatment. If someone nneed more than two insulins
   we only need to add code to change GUI. (Andy)

I: Pump and CGM support

A: Pump support is in plan. When I get a pump, then some type of support will
   be added. At start probably just manual entry (by end of 2008) and at later 
   time also reading data from pump. Support will be added for pump companies, 
   which will help us with providing protocol for communication.  
   If users will supply log of communication, it will be possible even 
   without this protocols. (Andy)
   
   As for CGM... no support planned at this moment... (Andy)

I: Let the user enter the name of the carbohydrates unit he wants to use instead
   of hardcoding one particular name. It won't matter to the calculations (we can
   just regard them as an abstract carbohydrates units), and the user won't be
   dissatisfied because we use some outdated unit/don't offer his preferred unit.
   
A: This was possible till now, but with introduction of USDA and other food 
   databases, we can use only CH (carbo hydrates). Old BU (bread unit) can't be 
   used anymore. If user won't use database for getting CH info (which will be 
   preffered way in 0.3), he/she can write any value he/she wants, but it will
   be written as CH. If we give option to user to write here whatever he/she 
   wants, then there will be problems, because data retrived from database is 
   always CH, and if he/she writes that this is BU, I think that this won't 
   work... except if CH is same as BU (I never used BU myself), but even then it 
   would be weird. (Andy)
