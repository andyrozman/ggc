GNU Gluco Control (GGC)
=======================

1. ABOUT
========

Welcome to GNU Gluco Control (in further text GGC). GGC is open-source, java
application, intended to help you manage your diabetes. Open-source means that
application if freely available, together with it's source code, which means
that anybody can help with development.

Since this is open-source it means that there can be errors (geeks call them
bugs) in working of application, for this we apologize... Since we are diabetics
our-selves, we are trying to make this software the best it can be, but as you
know accidents happen. Please read this document through and find information, how
this software can become better, with a little help from your side (you don't have
to be developer to help, each reported problem can help us bring GGC closer to
perfection).

If you wish to help develop or officially test this software, please read companion
document 'How_I_Can_Help.txt' the same document is required reading for developers.


2. CURRENT VERSION AND STATUS
=============================

This is version 0.3 of GGC.

At this point we are at version 0.3, which is first public release. If you
installed any version prior to that, please uninstall. This version has
ability to update it-self, when new version is available.

This first public release can use only internal database. If you have more that
little computer knowledge, you can try to make it work with any database (see
section III) with just a little action.

New (major) versions are planned to occur in 6 month intervals. This means that
you can expect release 0.4 by end of this year (or start of next one).

Minor release will be done, when functionality has been change in such way, that
is beneficial to user to be released (major functionalities and major bug fixes)

For now you need to update files manually,
which means following instructions with release exactly (there will be file
'How To Upgrade.txt' supplied with each upgrade release).

5. SUB-PROJECTS
===============

Currently there are two sub-projects running.


METER-TOOL
-----------

This is plug-in for getting data from meter device. Currently this project is in
development phase. Together with support for Ascensia meters, we are finishing
up whole plug-in framework and all needed graphical interface forms (classes).
First alpha version, will be available around September 2008, together with finished
implementation for Ascensia meters. Next in line are Roche meters (December 2008)
and after them LifeScan meters (January 2009).


PUMP-TOOL
----------

This is plug-in for entering and retrieving data from pumps. This project is still
in planning phase. Project will move into development phase in September 2008, so
it might happen that next version (0.4) will already have part of pump tool
functionality. First supported pumps will those from Roche (April 2009),
after them probably Minimed.



6. HOW CAN I HELP AS REGULAR USER
==================================

There are several ways you can help. First and main one is to test software. Try to use
it and find if something doesn't work. Version 0.3 will be started from command-line
and all actions will also be displayed in console. If you see text error, exception or for
example many lines with list of classes with numbers, this means something went wrong.
Error is displayed on your screen, but it is also logged into file (<GGC_Root>\data\log).
There you will find one or more files for each day. If error happened today, there will be
file GGC.log. You need to open it and go to end and try to find previously displayed errors.
Zip this file and store it. And do the following (choose option A or B):

A.) Visit bug reporting site for our project and enter bug by yourself. Please attach zipped
   log. Site is following: (data should be entered in English)
   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49749&atid=457319  
   You don't need to be member of sourceforge to add this information, if you are not please
   write your email somewhere in error report. Describe exactly what you were doing when
   exception happened and how did problem affect your application, also please let us know
   configuration of your computer (for example: Celereon 2000 with 2 Gb Ram, running Ubuntu
   Linux, kernel 2.4.1.34, with java 1.6_06)

B.) Send us email (ggc@atech-software.com), with all data described in point A.

---

If everything works OK on your system, we still ask you to send us logs. Every month or so,
please zip all log files (you can remove them from log directory) and send them to
ggc@atech-software.com.

We will use some tool to read through all files and see if there was some error which has gone
undiscovered by you and will try to fix it.

---

So you have been using software sometime, some things work good, other not so. If you find parts
of GGC, which your think could work better, please let us know. If you find that some
functionality is missing, again let us know. You can use either email, or you can use
following form: (data should be entered in English)
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=49749&atid=457322

---

We will try to fix problems as soon as possible, but since there are only two of us (three, but
only 2 active) it might take time... Major bugs will be fixed first, then there are minor bugs...
New functionality proposals are last (and planned functionality has priority).

Maybe some new developers will now join us and help us to develop this application further.




7. END

Again, thank you for using our software, I hope it fulfills your needs... If not yet, maybe in
future.
