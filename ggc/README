GNU Gluco Control (GGC) is a pure Java application helping you to manage your
diabetes.

Currently, we are in a very early stage of development. Most likely it will
not run on your system. You need to edit the sources to reflect your system
configuration. You also need the:
 javacomm api <http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm>
installed on your system, if you want to access your "GlucoCard" Meter. It is
the only meter avaible to me, so there will be no support for additional
meters in the near future. But, you are invited to write on, or give us the
protocol specification for your meter ;-)

Install:
========

1. Get the sources from the sf cvs servers.
2. Compile them.
3. Run GGC:

	#java ggc

   Hint: I need to run the VM with the -noverify switch, to get the commapi
   running:

	#java -noverify ggc

(Make sure you have all required classes in your classpath)

Future:
=======

The first version which is indented for _normal_ users (!= programmer) will
be version 0.1! Until this release only developers should use the program.
