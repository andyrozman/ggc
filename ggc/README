GNU Gluco Control (GGC) is a pure Java application helping you to manage your
diabetes.

Currently, we are in a very early stage of development.

You need the commapi:
 javacomm api <http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm>
installed on your system, if you want to access your "GlucoCard" Meter. It is
the only meter avaible to me, so there will be no support for additional
meters in the near future. But, you are invited to write on, or give us the
protocol specification for your meter ;-)

If you want to store your data in a MySQL Database (recommended), you need this 
driver:
 mm.mysql.jdbc <http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc.html>

Install:
========

CVS:

1. Get the sources from the sf cvs servers.
2. Compile them.
3. Run GGC:

	#java ggc

   Hint: I need to run the VM with the -noverify switch, to get the commapi
   running:

	#java -noverify ggc

(Make sure you have all required classes in your classpath)

Packaged Version:

1. Download the package (from sourcforge).
2. Extract it:

        #gunzip ggc_<version>.tar.gz

3. Untar it:
	
	#tar xf ggc_<version>.tar

   This will create a new directory named 'ggc'. There you find all resources,
   sources and a *.jar file.

4. Run GGC:

	#java -jar ggc.jar

5. Have fun while testing.

Future:
=======

The first version which is indented for _normal_ users (!= programmer) will
be version 0.1! Until this release only developers should use the program.
