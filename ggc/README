GNU Gluco Control (GGC)
=======================

This readme file has now four section, which are:
I.   GGC BASIC INFORMATION
II.  USER INFORMATION
III. TRANSLATORS INFORMATION
IV.  DEVELOPERS INFORMATION

End users only need to read the first section, translators first and second, and 
developers all 3 of them.

At this time there is no user release for GGC, so users must install everything 
with help of development section.



*******************************
I.  USER INFORMATION
*******************************

1. About
========
GNU Gluco Control (GGC) is a pure Java application intended to help you to manage
your diabetes.


2. Status
=========

As before we are at a very early stage of development. For database we are now using
hibernate so all old ways of storing data are removed... Sorry. (if you used ggc in 
old times, please contact us and we will help you to get data in new database)

This version (0.2.4) is not intended for end users. Versions intended for end users 
will be deployed on sourceforge.net, at first point we have a somewhat workable 
version (1st release with some additional functionaly is planned for May 2007).

  


*******************************
II.  USER INFORMATION
*******************************

If you are brave enough see section IV, A.), Step 1-3. If you are using windows platform
take GGC*.exe file from sourceforge.net, which will install application for you. Only 
prerequisite is that you have java 1.5 or higher installed.




*******************************
III.  TRANSLATORS INFORMATION
*******************************

I18nCheck - This utility helps translators to see if their language file has all 
    keywords in language files (in development process we add keywords in default
    language file (english), so translators only need to translate new keywords).

Note: Langauge file must be ASCII file with unicode escape codes. Translator are 
    not limited with this. They can use any UTF like editor, and type their characters
    without problems. At end of translation they need to run JDK tool native2ascii,
    which will change your characters into unicode escape sequences (be carefull, you
    must save language file in utf).




*******************************
IV.  DEVELOPERS INFORMATION
*******************************


All information on how to start with development is stored in this file. 


If you are Database Guru and prefer to use your own database (which must be supported 
by Hibernate 3.x, which we use, see: www.hibernate.org for list), go to step B, if 
you don't know anything about database, database administration, use step B. Read 
step C as follow-up to both A and B steps.



A.) Easy way (no database and/or hibernate knowledge needed)
============================================================

1.) Download latest GGC*.zip file from sourceforge.net
2.) Unpack this file to directory of your choice, for this example we will use
    c:\ggc (same goes for linux/unix/mac, you just need to use different directories
	and chars for directory separation.
3.) OK. Now you have latest released version of ggc running. You can now run GGC.

---

4.) Download your favorite SVN client (subversion)
5.) Retrive latest svn snapshot
6.) Create following directories under c:\gcc, /build/classes
7.) Rename SVN_REP/trunk/ggc/build/GGCBuild.properties_default to 
    SVN_REP/trunk/ggc/build/GGCBuild.properties (SVN_REP is root of where your SVN 
	client puts files)
8.) Edit GGCBuild.properties, you need to change only outdir.dir parameter to directory 
    where you placed content of GGC*.zip file
9.) Install ANT 1.6 or newer (ant.apache.org, if you can please install version 1.6.x).
10.) Use 'ant copy' tyo copy all needed files for running
11.) Use 'ant build_gcc' to build all
12.) now go to d:\ggc\build\classes and try running new built version of GCC. If there 
     is error on running, check run.cmd (or run.sh)




1. How to install (SVN Version)
===============================

Installation is a little tricky. 

If you value your time, please download GGC_*.zip from sf.net and then follow needed steps. If you use this 
image you will have needed tree structure and internal database with all nutrition data, ready to test.


1. Please get newest version from SVN. 

2. Go to build directory. Rename GGCBuild.properties_default to GGCBuild.properties. Edit 
    GGCBuild.properties to reflect your directories. 
    
3. Please follow instructions in "GGC ANT Build How-TO.txt" and build everything.

4. Copy files from source directory to your build (classes) directory.
	GGC_*.properties
	log4j.properties
	*.hbm.xml
	run.cmd

5. Install Database. For testing purposes there was built internal database placed into svn.
    You must download ggc_db.zip (ggc_db_nutr.zip if you want whole nutrition database).
    Put files into ../data directory. 
    
    If you wish to use your own external database see GGC_Config.properties and edit it
    accordingly (don't forget to set SELECTED_DB). In SVN there is test_nutrition.zip 
    where you can find special *.cmd file which must be edited and you can use it to create 
    database and add nutrition entries (you must put nutrition database (found in ggc-support 
    files on sf.net)) to directory ../data/nutrition.
    
6. Run ggc software: (first edit run.cmd) 
    run.cmd




Not yet done.





















OLD README
----------



GNU Gluco Control (GGC) is a pure Java application helping you to manage your
diabetes.

Currently, we are in a very early stage of development.

You need the commapi:
 javacomm api <http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm>
installed on your system, if you want to access your "GlucoCard" Meter. It is
the only meter avaible to me, so there will be no support for additional
meters in the near future. But, you are invited to write on, or give us the
protocol specification for your meter ;-)

If you want to store your data in a MySQL Database (recommended), you need this 
driver:
 mm.mysql.jdbc <http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc.html>

Install:
========

CVS:

1. Get the sources from the sf cvs servers.
2. Compile them.
3. Run GGC:

	#java ggc

   Hint: I need to run the VM with the -noverify switch, to get the commapi
   running:

	#java -noverify ggc

(Make sure you have all required classes in your classpath)

Packaged Version:

1. Download the package (from sourcforge).
2. Extract it:

        #gunzip ggc_<version>.tar.gz

3. Untar it:
	
	#tar xf ggc_<version>.tar

   This will create a new directory named 'ggc'. There you find all resources,
   sources and a *.jar file.

4. Run GGC:

	#java -jar ggc.jar

5. Have fun while testing.

Future:
=======

The first version which is indented for _normal_ users (!= programmer) will
be version 0.1! Until this release only developers should use the program.
