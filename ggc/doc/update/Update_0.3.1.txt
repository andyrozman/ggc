
Update 0.3.1
=============

This update is minor, but REQUIRED update. It needs to be applied to 0.3 release (if you apply it anywhere else
it will damage the installation).


In update package are three directories, which you need to copy (and overwrite) to existing installation 
directory. It contains these files):

docs\*                                  - here are several doc files about updates and this update specifically 
data\update\GGC_Update.properties       - update file (for generation of new startup scripts)
lib\utils\atech-tools-0.2.5.jar         - this is actual library which is new



How to apply this update
=========================

1. Open zip file and extract all files in some temporary directory
2. Select all extracted directories and right click on them and select option Copy or Cut
3. Browse to your installation of GGC (usually this is something like c:\Program Files\GGC)
4. You should be in original install directory contains several sub-directories (bin, docs, lib, ...),
   right click here and issue command Paste. Copying will start and you will be asked to overwrite
   files, on every question answer "Yes overwrite".

What does this update fix
=========================

This update will not increase application version, you will still see application as version 0.3. 

This update fixes minor bug in backup/restore function. In previous version, backup was made in codepage
supported by operating system. This sometimes creates problem on restore, because database requires all
entries to be in UTF-8 format. This fix forces backup to write files in utf-8 format, which gives us 
possibilty to make backup/restore of database, which is requirement for applying any update.
