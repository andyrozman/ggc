How To Use GGC on USB
======================

GGC is application that can easily be run from USB disk. We had some problems with earlier 
version because database we used, needed a lot of time to shutdown, after several tries
we found database, we currently use (H2 Database) which work great also with USB drives.


How to prepare version for USB
================================

For application to run on USB, we need to download VM from GGC site (you need to download 
only package for OSes, which you plan to use). Each VM package contains Java Runtime
Environment for selected OS, and startup file for that OS. Install VM first, because when 
you copy file from GGC, they might have newer startup files.

After install of VM (we will make example with Linux), you will have following tree structure

Root
  |-- GNU_Gluco_Control
  |          |- bin
  |-- Linux
        |--- jre16
               |--- bin
                ....
                
In root there are several file which might help with autostart (on some systems).

After install of all wanted VMs, you can download latest release of GGC (in .zip file)
and just copy content of archive into GNU_Gluco_Control.



Supported OSes
==============
              
We support several OSes here, if you have any special OS, which you want supported, you 
can make support your-self (VM), but we will have to help to change software. We have 
special utilities for creating startup files needed (this is required for update system, we
are implementing), and we need to modify those (this takes, about a day or so, so it 
shouldn't be a problem). When you have problems, or new OS, contact us on: 
ggc@atech-software.com.

Some of tools use libraries for accessing serial/USB devices via rxtx library. If binary 
files for your OS are not present in rxtx*.zip file, you won't be able to use serial/USB
features of application (for connection to external devices - meters, pumps, ...). There
are a lot of sources from where you can get binary files for your OS.


OS               | Java ver. |  VM   | Rxtx  |  Comments
--------------------------------------------------------------
Windows          |    1.6    |  Yes  |  Yes  |   
Linux            |    1.6    |  Yes  |  Yes  |   
FreeBSD          |    1.6    |  Yes  |  No   | Rxtx bin. found, but it has problems...
