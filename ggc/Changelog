    * Moved ANT build files to build directory and removed all those in root
    * ARCHITECTURE CHANGE: I added Hibernate (v3.1) framework to ggc (download in support as 
        hibernate3.zip). For now hibernate is used just for nutrition part, but after I
	finish nutrition and meals, I will change all other code, to use hibernate. With
	this we will remove several files needed for talking to different database. 
	Hibernate is object relational database framework, which can talk to almost any 
	database without any change to our code.
    * Finished nutrition import
    * Added hibernate data classes, datalayer classes and main GGCDb class which handle 
        hibernate database. With this we have database support for nutrition module.
    * Added classes for working with nutrition. Tree dialog is finished, also TreeModel,
        but I still need to change panels that display info on selected tree item. This
	code is now available, but is so far not added to ggc. For testing this you must 
	set an external database, get jdbc driver for it, set user, password and empty 
	database, then write this settings to GGC_Config.properties under database 1 (or
	you can add one for yourself and set SELECTED_DB value). After you have all this
	you can unpack test_nutrition.zip to your build directory (where all compiled
	classes go), then you take USDA_Nutrient_Db_for_Standard_Reference_r18.zip from
	ggc-support cvs tree and unpack it to ../data/nutrition (from your build directory).
	First you run nut_init for initialization of database and it's filling and then
	you can use nut_tree to see nutrition tree.
     * Fixed comments in ggc.little package

    * OK, figured out problem with compiling ggc.little.DailyStatsPanel: this seems to
        require java 1.5
    * ggc.util.GGCPropertiesHelper: undid a change to the data dir path that was supposed
        to be local but forgotten
    * looks like eclipse committed my .classpath and .cvsignore, trying to fix

2006-03-04 Reinhold Rumberger <rumbi@users.sourceforge.net>
    * GGC_DE.properties: renamed to GGC_de.properties, some more work on the translation
    * GGC_EN.properties: some spellchecking, no version or date changes since
        this doesn't really imply that other translations need to be adopted
    * ggc.util.I18nControl:
      - moved header to the top
      - made EN the fallback default locale, as english is the master language file
    * ggc.gui.MainFrame:
      - hardcoded skin location in a field at the top of the file instead of somewhere
        in the code, to make this a tiny little bit more flexible
      - changed the path in accordance with cvs repository layout
    * ggc.util.GGCPropertiesHelper: pretty much same as above for data directory and
        config file location
    * MANIFEST.MF: I think this meant ggc.GGC, not just ggc (in Main-Class)
    * ggc.little.LittleInfoPanel: had wrong package declaration
    * ggc.little.DailyStatsPanel: doesn't seem to compile here (see "// XXX:" comment)
    * PROBLEM: There suddenly are some mysterious "org.apache.commons" and "org.hibernate"
        imports I can't seem to resolve

2006-03-01 Reinhold Rumberger <rumbi@users.sourceforge.net>
    * fix: ggc.nutrition.NutritionTree still thought it was named TreeDemo
           (constructor, some calls inside the class)
    * ggc.data.imports.*: a char -> int cast is unnecessary, deleted them.
    * ggc.view.CourseGraphView: same for int -> float casts
        If those casts were there for a reason, please feel free to re-insert
        them and tell me how stupid I am :-P
    * randomly scattered throughout the project, hopefully not creating too
      many conflicts:
        - optimized import section (<Shift> - <O> in eclipse)
        - added several questions (see TODO comments)
    * ggc.util.VersionChecker: added two questions, if I forget to start 
        a discussion, could somebody else, please?
    * GGC_DE.properties: Added newest version of my German translation
