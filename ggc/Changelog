    * GGC_DE.properties: renamed to GGC_de.properties, some more work on the translation
    * GGC_EN.properties: some spellchecking, no version or date changes since
        this doesn't really imply that other translations need to be adopted
    * ggc.util.I18nControl:
      - moved header to the top
      - made EN the fallback default locale, as english is the master language file
    * ggc.gui.MainFrame:
      - hardcoded skin location in a field at the top of the file instead of somewhere
        in the code, to make this a tiny little bit more flexible
      - changed the path in accordance with cvs repository layout
    * ggc.util.GGCPropertiesHelper: pretty much same as above for data directory and
        config file location
    * MANIFEST.MF: I think this meant ggc.GGC, not just ggc (in Main-Class)
    * ggc.little.LittleInfoPanel: had wrong package declaration
    * ggc.little.DailyStatsPanel: doesn't seem to compile here (see "// XXX:" comment)
    * PROBLEM: There suddenly are some mysterious "org.apache.commons" and "org.hibernate"
        imports I can't seem to resolve

2006-03-01 Reinhold Rumberger <rumbi@users.sourceforge.net>
    * fix: ggc.nutrition.NutritionTree still thought it was named TreeDemo
           (constructor, some calls inside the class)
    * ggc.data.imports.*: a char -> int cast is unnecessary, deleted them.
    * ggc.view.CourseGraphView: same for int -> float casts
        If those casts were there for a reason, please feel free to re-insert
        them and tell me how stupid I am :-P
    * randomly scattered throughout the project, hopefully not creating too
      many conflicts:
        - optimized import section (<Shift> - <O> in eclipse)
        - added several questions (see TODO comments)
    * ggc.util.VersionChecker: added two questions, if I forget to start 
        a discussion, could somebody else, please?
    * GGC_DE.properties: Added newest version of my German translation
