        meters available arround, those that are supported by GGC will have some other entries, so 
	that user has overview over most available meters. (so far list has 34 meters, only 3 are supported 
	to be read by application, another 7 are in the works (Ascensia) and will be available in 0.4 version

               packages have no business reading things like password and username
             - used constants for loadStatus to make code more readable and future
               changes easier

      we can print only 2006 month 4, and times settings for meals are

      must be done in config (in next release).

2006-04-28 (v0.2.2.2) Andy Rozman <andyrozman@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Meter handling. There are new files added for meter handling. I plan to add 
      support for some of meters in future, and I will change way how to get data.

      interfaces.

2006-04-23 Andy Rozman <andyrozman@users.sourceforge.net>
    * update of slovene language file
    * some of translation done

    * updated ggc_db_nutr.zip and test_nutrition.zip with new versions of database
      and config files, so that they now also contain config (which is almost finished)

2006-04-18 (v0.2.1.12) Andy Rozman <andyrozman@users.sourceforge.net>

    * moved ggc.gui.PropertiesFrame to ggc.gui.dialogs.PropertiesDialog, and changed internal

      yet, but it's now usable without getting any exceptions.
    * Configuration of meters now displays meters correctly
    * Added Time calculation methods in DataAccess (we got wrong time as 
      GregorianCalendar and database returned nothing).

2006-04-10 Reinhold Rumberger <rumbi@users.sourceforge.net>
    * new function getDisplayedBG() in DataAccess, not used yet

2006-04-08 Reinhold Rumberger <rumbi@users.sourceforge.net>
    * started changing AbstractGraphView to make selection of BG unit type possible
    * added unit to BG axis in DailyGraphView, couldn't do others as I can't access them

        (HOST_UNAVAILABLE_INFO, HOST_UNAVAILABLE_MSG)
    * ggc.util.VersionChecker.isNewVersion:
      - made variable names more intuitive assuming the code is correct ;-P
      - added javadoc comment for that method
    * build/build.xml: translation files don't have to be specified individually anymore

2006-04-04 (v0.2.1.2) Andy Rozman <andyrozman@users.sourceforge.net>
    * DailyStatsFrame was moved and renamed to dialogs.DailyStatsDialog

2006-03-11 Reinhold Rumberger <rumbi@users.sourceforge.net>
    * ggc.util.I18nControl:
      - made private static final Locale defaultLocale and set it to Locale.ENGLISH
      - set Locale.defaultLocale() to defaultLocale; this will make ResourceBundle look
        here for entries it can't find in the current locale and look at this locale if
        the required locale couldn't be found
    * ggc.util.GGCPropertiesHelper: made some Strings final
    * renamed GGC_XX.properties to GGC_xx.properties
    * ggc.db.TextFileHandler: see XXX comments
    * fixes: fixed some exceptions

      time format was meant and squashed an exception thrown when this occurred
    * ggc.util.GGCProperties: data.imports.* changed to ggc.data.imports.*
    * BUG: data import from meter throws a ClassCastException in
        javax.swing.AbstractButton.configurePropertiesFromAction on line 1117 (attempted
        cast to Integer, I'm too unfamiliar with the Actions used here to be able to
        further debug anything)
    * BUG: Daily stats -> add row -> change day -> add some values in the add row frame
    	-> new entry -> NO error, exception or anything wrong looking -> change back to
    	original day: no new entries, either here or anywhere else
    * added language selection to prefPane; implementation is rather hackish and a
      restart is required if this setting is changed; the main problem with this
      implementation is an endless loop because the constructor of GGCProperties
      depends on I18nControl

2006-03-11  Andy Rozman <andyrozman@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Moved ANT build files to build directory and removed all those in root
    * ARCHITECTURE CHANGE: I added Hibernate (v3.1) framework to ggc (download in support as 
        hibernate3.zip). For now hibernate is used just for nutrition part, but after I
	finish nutrition and meals, I will change all other code, to use hibernate. With
	this we will remove several files needed for talking to different database. 
	Hibernate is object relational database framework, which can talk to almost any 
	database without any change to our code.
    * Finished nutrition import
    * Added hibernate data classes, datalayer classes and main GGCDb class which handle 
        hibernate database. With this we have database support for nutrition module.
    * Added classes for working with nutrition. Tree dialog is finished, also TreeModel,
        but I still need to change panels that display info on selected tree item. This
	code is now available, but is so far not added to ggc. For testing this you must 
	set an external database, get jdbc driver for it, set user, password and empty 
	database, then write this settings to GGC_Config.properties under database 1 (or
	you can add one for yourself and set SELECTED_DB value). After you have all this
	you can unpack test_nutrition.zip to your build directory (where all compiled
	classes go), then you take USDA_Nutrient_Db_for_Standard_Reference_r18.zip from
	ggc-support cvs tree and unpack it to ../data/nutrition (from your build directory).
	First you run nut_init for initialization of database and it's filling and then
	you can use nut_tree to see nutrition tree.
     * Fixed comments in ggc.little package	

2006-03-10 Reinhold Rumberger <rumbi@users.sourceforge.net>
    * ggc.util.GGCPropertiesHelper: method read(): made error message in case of
        IOException a bit more verbose
    * GGC_DE.properties: more translation

2006-03-05 Reinhold Rumberger <rumbi@users.sourceforge.net>
    * OK, figured out problem with compiling ggc.little.DailyStatsPanel: this seems to
        require java 1.5
    * ggc.util.GGCPropertiesHelper: undid a change to the data dir path that was supposed
        to be local but forgotten
    * looks like eclipse committed my .classpath and .cvsignore, trying to fix

2006-03-04 Reinhold Rumberger <rumbi@users.sourceforge.net>
    * GGC_DE.properties: some more work on the translation
    * GGC_EN.properties: some spellchecking, no version or date changes since
        this doesn't really imply that other translations need to be adopted
    * ggc.util.I18nControl:
      - moved header to the top
      - made EN the fallback default locale, as english is the master language file
    * ggc.gui.MainFrame:
      - hardcoded skin location in a field at the top of the file instead of somewhere
        in the code, to make this a tiny little bit more flexible
      - changed the path in accordance with cvs repository layout
    * ggc.util.GGCPropertiesHelper: pretty much same as above for data directory and
        config file location
    * MANIFEST.MF: I think this meant ggc.GGC, not just ggc (in Main-Class)
    * ggc.little.LittleInfoPanel: had wrong package declaration
    * ggc.little.DailyStatsPanel: doesn't seem to compile here (see "// XXX:" comment)
    * PROBLEM: There suddenly are some mysterious "org.apache.commons" and "org.hibernate"
        imports I can't seem to resolve

2006-03-01 Reinhold Rumberger <rumbi@users.sourceforge.net>
    * ggc.data.imports.*: a char -> int cast is unnecessary, deleted them.
    * ggc.view.CourseGraphView: same for int -> float casts
        If those casts were there for a reason, please feel free to re-insert
        them and tell me how stupid I am :-P
    * randomly scattered throughout the project, hopefully not creating too
      many conflicts:
        - optimized import section (<Shift> - <O> in eclipse)
        - added several questions (see TODO comments)
    * ggc.util.VersionChecker: added two questions, if I forget to start 
        a discussion, could somebody else, please?
    * GGC_DE.properties: Added newest version of my German translation
