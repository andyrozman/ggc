Now, we need your help... We are just before release of GGC 0.5, and we would need some testers. You 
don't have to be "professionals" (professional testers in software development companies), 
you just need to be willing to put some time aside (about day or two, every few months, usually 
about month before release). We currently have about 0-2 releases per year, but in next few months, 
we plan to release our new update system, which would probably bring this number to 2-4 per year.<br><br>

As I said we need few people willing to go through all functionalities, play with your
devices and determine if GGC works ok. We don't have test plan written yet, but at this point 
administrator will point you to functionalities that were added (or cahnged), and which need to be tested.<br><br> 
<b>If (and I hope we do)</b> we manage to establish team of testers (at least few of them), we (developers 
and release admin) will write testing manual, with all test cases, which will be then expanded with each 
new functionality...<br><br>
We will need GGC Core testers and GGC Hardware testers. Core testers will mainly look at main 
application and plugins from user view (if everything works ok, if there are errors, etc.), while 
Hardware testers will look at different hardware (probably their own) and compare transfered data with data
that is stored in GGC after transfer.<br><br>
In 0.5 we changed way data is transfered from meter devices (we added support to framework, which 
allows to transfer data, that is not only BG, but also other data (for "special" meters like 
XCeed, Aviva Combo,...)), which is why release is so late. We are now testing stuff, but we need 
an outsider (not developer), to look things over.<br><br>
