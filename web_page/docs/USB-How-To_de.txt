****  Wie benutze ich GGC von USB-Laufwerken  ****
**************************************************

GGC ist eine Anwendung die problemlos von USB-Laufwerken aus gestartet werden
kann. Wir hatten mit früheren Versionen einige Probleme weil die Datenbank, die
wir benutzten viel Zeit zum Stoppen brauchte. Mittlerweile haben wir eine
Datenbank (H2) gefunden, die auch auf USB-Laufwerken problemlos funktioniert.
Eine Beschreibung der meisten Ausdrücke ist in README_1st.de enthalten.

How to prepare/install GGC for/on USB
=======================================

For application to run on USB, we need to download GVM from GGC site (you need to download 
only package for OSes, which you plan to use). Each GVM package contains Java Runtime
Environment for selected OS, startup files for that OS and Rxtx binary (if available). 
Install GVM first, because when you copy file from GGC, they might have newer startup files.

After install of VM (we will make example with Linux), you will have following tree structure

Root
  |-- GNU_Gluco_Control
  |          |- bin
             |- lib
                 |- native
                      |- linux
                           ...
             |- java
                 |- autorun
                 |- linux
                
In java\autorun directory there will be some files, which could be used for autorun from USB 
on some system. Since this is not needed for running of GGC, you will have to figure how to use 
it on your own.

After install of all wanted VMs, you can download latest release of GGC (in .zip file)
and just copy content of archive into GNU_Gluco_Control.


How to create GVM
==================

In case that your OS has no GVM, you might be able to create your own. Use following steps:

1. Read README_1st, there you will find how Startup system works.

2. Create all startup files in \bin directory. If your OS is not supported, you will have to contact us,
   to do our job (add support into startup java library).

3. Download correct JRE for your OS. You need Java 1.5, but it is prefered to get 1.6 if 
   available. Copy content to \java\<OS-short-name> directory.
   
4. Find binary files for Rxtx 2.1.7 and put them into \lib\native\<OS-short-name>. This file must be
   architecture specific, if you can find files for all architecture, get them and put them into 
   subdirectories (for example for windows, if you get x32 and x64, you create directories x32 and
   x64 and put correct files there. In case of multiple architecture files, leave root empty (and
   user will then copy correct file by themselves.

5. If your OS supports autorun (when USB inserted), you can create files and put them into \java\autorun
   directory.

6. Create file GVM_<OS-short-name>.txt and write into it, all notes and also your info, so that your are 
   credited for work you have done. If you are willing to be supporter for this specific GVM, add 
   also your email, so that people can contact you.


Supported OSes
==============

Take a look into README_1st for list of all supported OSes.

Not all supported OSes have GVM (most do but not all). On Mac it's very hard to get this
files, since they are part of system.
