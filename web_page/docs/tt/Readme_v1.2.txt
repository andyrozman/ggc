1. Introduction
================

(Simple) Translation Tool (in further text TT) is tool for translation of application files 
intended for internationalization of (java) applications. 


2. Quick description of how application works
===============================================

Application works by reading module configuration file (which is supplied by software 
vendor/developer), this file simply tells which module/application we are translating for. 
Next are so called master files, which are files that developers create, when making 
application (this are files containing mostly words to translate and also some special 
codes which enable us to read file and translate it). Both master file and translation 
file can also have configuration files, but this is used just internally (this file must 
not be deleted).

Internal directory structure:

    TT_Root (here you should copy correct (for operating system) startup batch files)
       |- bin (contains all startup batch files and TT, startup files won't work from here !!!)
       |- config (contains configurations for application and also user config files)
       |- docs (some documentation)
       |- files
            |- master_files (master files and master file configurations)
                    |- original
                         |-<version> (contains original master files for each langpack)
            |- translation (here are results of your work)
                    |- backup (automatic backup files)
            |- trans_original
                    |- <version>  (contains translation files for all supported languages)
                          ...


3. Quick How To
================

1. Now first you need to download TT package. This file contains atech-tools library, with
   working version of TT (0.4.2 or latest) and some startup files. (when application tool
   changes there will be new version of this file). Unpack this into some directory.
   
2. Secondly you need configuration files for application you are translating. This is so
   called Language Base Pack for certain application (<AppShortName>_Lang_Base_<version>.zip). 
   You will need to download this file just once, if not differently specified by developer.
   This will contain configuration files for application. Unpack this into same directories 
   as files from step 1. You will get also some new documentation specific to application you 
   are developing.  
   
3. Actual language files. This file (<AppShortName>_LangPack_<version_of_lang_pack>.zip. This 
   archive contains language files (master files and optional config files) and also latest 
   translations. You need to unpack to directory from step 1. New master files will overwrite 
   the old ones. Original (as supplied with application) translations will be stored into 
   files\trans_original\<lang_pack_version>. There you can also find list of currently supported
   languages. 
   
4. Now you need to modify (or copy from .config_default) TranslatorSettings.config file (config
   directory). There you set settings for you (as translator) and settings for languages you are
   translating. More on that in section 4.5.
    
5. Now you can start with work. On how you will deploy files that you translate, you need to 
   consult documentation from Lang_Base. Same goes for testing. Application needs to implement
   functionality, so that you can test files, without making changes to your applications .jar
   files.    
  


4. Description of different files
==========================================


4.1. Module configuration file
-------------------------------

This is configuration file for specific module (or whole application). It contains just few 
settings about main configuration file. It is required for translation. This file will be 
probably accompanied with startup files for staring TT with this configuration file. 


4.2. Master file
-----------------

This is main file which we translate. We can replace this file without problems. When we start 
application again, file will be read, and new translation keywords will be added to our translation 
file. 


4.3. Master configuration file
--------------------------------

Configuration file contains descriptions about keywords (this won't be filled in most cases since
it is quite a lot of work. Most important configuration setting here is, from when *new* 
translation is (in case that translation for some keyword changes, then there will be entry here, so
that we know that we need to refresh translation.


4.4. Translation files (also config)
-------------------------------------

It contains all keywords from our master file, even if they are not translated. In first read 
configuration file is created with tags if words are created. As we translate this tags are 
changed.


4.5. TranslatorSettings.config
-------------------------------

This is file that person translating needs to change. This are mostly settings that will be written 
to translation file or setting for TT.

TRANSLATOR_NAME : Name of translator (you)
TRANSLATOR_EMAIL : Email of translator (you can write here ggc@atech-software.com), if you are
                   unwilling to answer to mails about your translation
TRANSLATION_LANGUAGE: Long name for language (for example for french here would be French)
TRANSLATION_LANGUAGE_SHORT: Short (2 letter code for translation, french would be fr)
AUTOBACKUP_TIME: How often do you want to have backup done (time in minutes)
COLLATION_RULES: You need to define collation rules for langauge, this is order in which letters
                 are in alphabet (see TranslatorSettings.config_default for sample) 

HEADER_COMMENT_X: Header comments
HEADER_COMMENT_<MODULE_ID>_X: Module specific header (module id is in Module configuration file 
                              see 4.1)
