
Changes file for GGC Meter Tool
===============================

0.1.4 08-10
    * Pump Definitions extended (Pump Interface will change later)
    * PumpValues contexts were extended. Pump entries, need to be viewed as data for whole day, not as separate 
      records, which will also be the way to compare them to old ones. Generation of day records, must be
      unified (how will be determined later)

0.1.3 08-09
    * modification to PumpInterface to include Alaram and Event mappings


2008-08-08 (0.1.2)
    * first integration into ggc
    * changes to Output classes and display classes (inspired by Roche AccuCheck Pix device)
    * moved AccuChek Pix device, creation of Accu-Chek pump devices
    * added ggc.pump.data.defs contains PumpAlarms, PumpEvents, PumpReport and PumpDataType classes (work in progres)
    * started work on reading Roche/Accu-Chek Xml file


2008-07-10 (v0.1.1) Andy Rozman <andyrozman@users.sourceforge.net>
    * pump tool project started (implementation)
    * basic framework created. All pump related files created from meter tool application
    * new files created for different outputs, creation of basic structure:
    
     meter_tools

           |
           |-- pump

           |       protocol             (protocol for communication)
           |       test                 (test stuff) 
           |       util                 (util)
           |-- web                      (for displaying different pump (list)
    
    
    * most of base stuff is implemented (outputs for example, some base protocols, guis, configuration)
    * everything was copied from meter tools 0.2, most of stuff will need to be enchanched and changed, but
      base stuff is now here.
    * created plug in class for connection to GGC
