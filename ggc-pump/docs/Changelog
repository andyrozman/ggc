1.0.2 [6.8.2009] 
    * Started tinkering with Dana device and BlueTooth connection
    * Plugin changed fully to v2 framework, all menus are now created directly in plugin

      basal patterns history. SmartPix doesn't show exact history of BP. We will try to make this work, 
      but until SmartPix is extended/fixed so long code won't be 100%, which means possible losss of some 
      BP history.

    * pump tool project started (implementation)
    * basic framework created. All pump related files created from meter tool application
    * new files created for different outputs, creation of basic structure:
    
     meter_tools
       |       
       |- ggc
           |
           |-- pump
           |       data
           |       device
           |              roche
           |       gui
           |           config
           |       list                 (list)
           |       output               (outputing data)
           |       protocol             (protocol for communication)
           |       test                 (test stuff) 
           |       util                 (util)
           |-- web                      (for displaying different pump (list)
    
    
    * most of base stuff is implemented (outputs for example, some base protocols, guis, configuration)
    * everything was copied from meter tools 0.2, most of stuff will need to be enchanched and changed, but
      base stuff is now here.
    * created plug in class for connection to GGC
