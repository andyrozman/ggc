<h1>Meter - Device Read Instructions</h1>
This is first screen, which you see when you start import. If configuration was not
valid, smaller message will be displayed, telling you to visit configuration. <br><br> 

<b>Description of screen:</b><br>
<b>Left side:</b> - picture of meter device.<br>
<b>Right side (up):</b> - configuration of meter device.<br>
<b>Right side (down):</b> - detailed instructions on how to connect meter and make it 
ready. It is advised to attach cables or any special device need for reading from 
meter, before starting GGC software (system sometimes needs more time to attach some
devices)).<br><br>

For succesful transfer we must first load old data (for filterning purposes). This usually
happens in miliseconds, but in case that there are a lot of records present it could take 
a while). While this reading is in progress there will be text above 'Start Downloading' 
button.<br><br>
When you have attached your meter to computer, and message above 'Start Downloading'
disappears, you are ready to go. Push 'Start Downloading' button and transfer will 
begin (or try to).
