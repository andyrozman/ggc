#  Collation Rules - In unicode we can create special rules for sorting where we specify
#     sorting order of special characters. This will be used by tree's and special tables.
#     For english this is left empty. For all other (that have non-standarn, non english
#     charcters) we need to set this if we want sorting to be done correctly.

#PUMP_PLUGIN_EXPERIMENTAL=Pumps Plug-in\n\nThis part is just experimental. We took quite a time\nto work on it and tried to add all needed functions\nand options. We did some testing, but we still need\nto add some functionalities and do more exhaustive\ntesting. Therefore this module is marked as experimental\nand may be used for testing only. At this point we also\ndon't support backup/restore, so even if data would be\nadded succesfully, we have no means to backup it up.\n\nThis is required step, before we delve into world of\nautomatic data retriveal from actual devices. Once \nthis testing is done, we can start with data retrieval.\n\nIf you find any problem here, or have any additional\noptions/ideas that could be added, don't hesitate to\ncontact us on our e-mail address:\nggc@atech-software.com.\n\n
