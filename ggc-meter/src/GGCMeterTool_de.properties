METERS_LIST_WEB_DESC=<html>Meters List is not list of all available Meters in the world, this is just list of some (mostly commonly used) Meters available. We add new devices here when our source page changes (www.diabetesnet.com) or if some user requests that their device is to be added. Meters in list are color coded, and color determines status of devices of selected company. Color coding description is shown at bottom of this page.<br></html>
