SIMPLE_PREFERENCES_HELP_CONTENT=<html><b>Note:</b> This is just temporary configuration. We wanted to ship Meter tool together with newest version of GGC, so we had to improvise a little. Real configuration will be much more user friendly, but also little more complicated...<br><br>Configuration file is simple file containing all configurations for your meters. On right side are two buttons, which will help you add configuration. You need to replace X, with number of meter.<br><br><b>First button</b> 'Insert Meter', will insert full configuration for selected device. You should change only two values: NAME and CONNECTION_PARAMETER. Value of CONNECTION_PARAMETER is your communication port on which you have your meter. NAME is your custom name.<br><br><b>Second button</b> 'Insert TimeZone' is little more complicated. We know that some places have daylight saving time. For this we need to change our clocks, but if for some reason you haven't changed time on you meter device, this setting can fix this automatically. For example our meter device is set correctly on winter time, but incorrectly on summer time, we can set this in that dialog.<br><br>For each meter device you <b>need to use <i>both</i> buttons</b>, if not configuration will not be valid.<br><br>Last we need to set is SELECTED_METER, with value of configuration, which we want to have active. Since we usually have only one meter, this value will probably be 1.</html>
