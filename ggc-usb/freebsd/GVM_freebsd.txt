Comments:  FreeBSD needs for each release number and each architecture separate java version. Same goes for rxtx
           native library, for this you will probably have to build files by your-self. 
           I have tested binary on i386 machine and it worked, but I had problem on amd64 architecture.
		   
	   If you have USB Bridge device, you will have to enable it before starting GGC.
	   Use following commands:
                kldload uplcom
                kldload ucom
		   
           Supplied files are for 7-RELEASE only. If you are unsure, please build your own.
		   
           FreeBSD also has port for rxtx (be carefull that it's version is 2.1.7-r2) in /ports/comms/rxtx.
		   
		   
HOW TO COMPILE RXTX:		   

Source files are in \lib directory, file rxtx-2.1-7r2.zip. Unpack file and enter into \src subdirectory (it's on 2nd 
level). Once you are there, run following commands:
   ./configure
   gmake 
   
This should probably be enough. If compile fails see file INSTALL for exact instructions. After compile has run, there 
will be directory called xxx-portbld-yyyy (xxx = architecture, yyyy = name of OS and version). Enter it and enter 
sub-directory .libs. In it there will be few files, librxtxSerial-zzzz, you will need to rename it to librxtxSerial.so 
(remove version onformation) and copy it to \lib\native\freebsd
