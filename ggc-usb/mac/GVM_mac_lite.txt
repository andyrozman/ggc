
GGC Virtual Machine
====================

OS:        Mac 
Java:      None (as Mac has Java integrated, required version is 1.5)
Rxtx:      present (we tested this on PPC but it's possible it will work on Intel too) [2.1.7]
Autorun:   not available

Comments:  Mac is something special among OSes. Java is integrated into OS itself, because of this it is impossible
           to extract all files. If you have at least java 1.5 installed you should be able to run this application.
