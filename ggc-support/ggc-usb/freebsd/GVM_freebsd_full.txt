Comments:  FreeBSD needs for each release number and each architecture separate java version. Same goes for rxtx
           native library. Because of this you will probably have to compile rxtx binary by yourself. 
		   

HOW TO COMPILE RXTX:		   

Source files are in \lib directory, file rxtx-2.1-7r2.zip. Unpack file and enter into \src subdirectory (it's on 2nd 
level). Once you are there, run following commands:
   ./configure
   gmake 
   
This should probably be enough. If compile fails see file INSTALL for exact instructions.


 

Rxtx has little problems running on FreeBSD. I am still looking for solution. After recompile
           rxtx doesn't work anymore, but problem will be solved with time. Attached is binary file, which 
		   should work with 7-RELEASE (i386), problem is that not all devices, that can be accessed are recognized.
