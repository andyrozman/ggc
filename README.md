# GNU Gluco Control - ggc
This project was hosted on sourceforge for a long time, but since github has much option that can help with release management and 
user/customer management and support I decided to move project here (project was moved in begining of April)... Everything on sourceforge will stay as it, with all repositories 
set to read-only, and all old discussions and history still available there (https://sourceforge.net/p/ggc/), but all the code and releases
will be created from here.

## Old Webpage
At the moment code in this repository is not working (in middle od restructuring) yet. You can get old version through old webpage: https://ggc.sourceforge.net/ for now. Last working version is 0.7.1 


## Discussions
I enabled discussions here, which should be used, if you have any questions.

## Issues
If you find any issues or have feature requests, please use "Issues" functionality.

## How can you help with development?
Development in GGC is mostly done in this project, but some of base functionalities are implemented also in atech-tools (repository can be 
found here in github), so you would probably need to download that repo too and link it into this project. 

As by default downloading the project and running "mvn clean install" should by default get you running. Required version of Java is 1.8+ (I 
recomend using latest amazon-correto-8) and recommended Maven 3.5.2.

## How can you use application?
I am in middle of big architectural change for GGC, so until this problem is solved, you will need one of old packages (available on sourceforge.net) 
until we get application running new way.
