
Changes file for GGC Plug-In Base
==================================

0.4.0
    * Changed reading of old data in reading classes
    * Framework changed, each plugin can (must) have it's own instance of Db, with which it handles all db
      data

0.3.3

0.3.2 
    * Added DeviceValuesRange class, which is used for getting data from device for same range (for printing 
      purposes for now, later probably for graphs too).
    
0.3.1
    * Changes which resulted from ggc-core beeing separate entity
    * Some minor changes to Configuration utility as is needed by Pump tools (no timezone fix)


0.2.7
    - minor changes to DataAccessPlugInBase, because of Atech Tools changes
    - DeviceValuesEntry now extends StatisticsItem 

0.2.6
    - Native Library problems fixed (if native part of Rxtx is missing there is now warning displayed)
      done when reading and configuration (we require new library for this jna-3.0.9)

    * Fixed GUI for configuration

0.2.4
    - fixed List functionality

0.2.3
    - changed GUI classes to use ATSwingUtils for better code visibility

0.2.2
    - moved most of data classes, here (DeviceValues, DeviceValuesDay, DeviceValuesEntry, 
      DeviceValuesTable, DeviceValuesTableModel)
    - because of move several new items were added DataAccess classes
    - moved GUI for reading data, this code is complete, but must be tested !!!
    - when adding GUI to plugins, we now need to implement only some methods in DataAccess*, 
      add *ValuesEntry (derived from DeviceValuesEntry), and *ValuesTableModel 
      (also derived)
    - we might have to change some stuff here, when we add new types of data, but changes 
      should be minor.
