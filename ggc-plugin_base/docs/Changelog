      DeviceValuesTable, DeviceValuesTableModel)
    - because of move several new items were added DataAccess classes
    - moved GUI for reading data, this code is complete, but must be tested !!!
    - when adding GUI to plugins, we now need to implement only some methods in DataAccess*,
      add *ValuesEntry (derived from DeviceValuesEntry), and *ValuesTableModel
      (also derived)
    - we might have to change some stuff here, when we add new types of data, but changes
      should be minor.
