#  Please use this file as default language file. Do not try to translate 
#  from any other files, since this is the Master language file. Create the
#  same header and specify application version number for easier changes at 
#  later time.
#  Translations should be grouped by groups as specified here. 
#  Older groups are done by packages, newer by logical name.

#
#  In brackets there are now tags which define urgency of some text beeing translated
#    1 - Needed, urgent (Base functionality, options which will be used by user mostly)
#    2 - Needed 
#    3 - Not used yet (in public releases)
#    4 - In implementation
#    
#    * - If tags also has *, then it means that this string can change regulary, last update is in []

#  COMMENT: Need to be fixed prior to use. Some of this translations might be done in Core. We created this file from Meter
#           and Core. Translators need to fix this prior to first use on Translation Tool.
