#  Please use this file as default language file. Do not try to translate 
#  from any other files, since this is the Master language file. Create the
#  same header and specify application version number for easier changes at 
#  later time.
#  Translations should be grouped by groups as specified here. 
#  Older groups are done by packages, newer by logical name.

#
#  In brackets there are now tags which define urgency of some text beeing translated
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_1=Needed, urgent (Base functionality, options which will be used by user mostly)
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_2=Needed 
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_3=Not used yet (in public releases)
#  !S! GROUP_PRIORITY_4=In implementation
#    
#    * - If tags also has *, then it means that this string can change regulary, last update is in []
#

#
#  Collation Rules - In unicode we can create special rules for sorting where we specify
#     sorting order of special characters. This will be used by tree's and special tables.
#     For english this is left empty. For all other (that have non-standarn, non english
#     charcters) we need to set this if we want sorting to be done correctly.
#
COLLATION_RULES= < a,A < b,B < c,C < d,D < e,E < f,F < g,G < h,H < i,I < j,J < k,K < l,L < m,M < n,N < o,O < p,P < q,Q < r,R < s,S < t,T < u,U < v,V < w,W < x,X < y,Y < z,Z
